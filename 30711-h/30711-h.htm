</div>

<p>Honest Sir John Falstaff talketh of &ldquo;minions of the moon;&rdquo;
and, truth to tell, two or three hundred years ago, nowhere
was such an order of knighthood more prevalent than upon
the Borders. Not only did the Scottish and English Borderers
make their forays across the Tweed and the ideal line,
but rival chieftains, though of the same nation, considered
themselves at liberty to make inroads upon the property of
each other. The laws of <em>meum</em> and <em>tuum</em> they were unable
to comprehend. Theirs was the strong man&#8217;s world, and
with them <em>might</em> was <em>right</em>. But to proceed with our
story. About the beginning of the seventeenth century, one of the
boldest knights upon the Borders was William Scott, the
young laird of Harden. His favourite residence was Oakwood
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Tower, a place of great strength, situated on the banks
of the Ettrick. The motto of his family was &ldquo;<em>Reparabit
cornua Ph&oelig;be</em>,&rdquo; which being interpreted by his countrymen,
in their vernacular idiom, ran thus&mdash;&ldquo;We&#8217;ll hae moonlight
again.&rdquo; Now, the young laird was one who considered it
his chief honour to give effect to both the spirit and the
letter of his family motto. Permitting us again to refer to
honest Falstaff, it implied that they were &ldquo;gentlemen of
the night;&rdquo; and he was not one who would loll upon his
pillow when his &ldquo;avocation&rdquo; called him to the foray.</p>

<p>It was drawing towards midnight, in the month of October,
when the leaves in the forest had become brown and
yellow, and with a hard sound rustled upon each other, that
young Scott called together his retainers, and addressing
them, said&mdash;&ldquo;Look ye, friends, is it not a crying sin and a
national shame to see things going aglee as they are doing?
There seems hardly such a thing as manhood left upon the
Borders. A bit scratch with a pen upon parchment is
becoming of more effect than a stroke with the sword. A
bairn now stands as good a chance to hold and to have, as
an armed man that has a hand to take and to defend. Such
a state o&#8217; things was only made for those who are ower
lazy to ride by night, and ower cowardly to fight. Never
shall it be said that I, William Scott of Harden, was one
who either submitted or conformed to it. Give me the
good, old, manly law, that &lsquo;they shall keep who can,&rsquo; and
wi&#8217; my honest sword will I maintain my right against
every enemy. Now, there is our natural and lawful adversary,
auld Sir Gideon Murray o&#8217; Elibank, carries his
head as high as though he were first cousin to a king, or
the sole lord o&#8217; Ettrick Forest. More than once has he
slighted me in a way which it wasna for a Scott to bear;
and weel do I ken that he has the will, and wants but the
power, to harry us o&#8217; house and ha&#8217;. But, by my troth,
he shall pay a dear reckoning for a&#8217; the insults he has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
offered to the Scotts o&#8217; Harden. Now, every Murray
among them has a weel-stocked mailing, and their kine are
weel-favoured; to-night the moon is laughing cannily
through the clouds:&mdash;therefore, what say ye, neighbours&mdash;will
ye ride wi&#8217; me to Elibank? and, before morning, every
man o&#8217; them shall have a toom byre.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurra!&rdquo; shouted they, &ldquo;for the young laird! He is a
true Scott from head to heel! Ride on, and we will follow
ye! Hurra!&mdash;the moon glents ower the hills to guide us to
the spoils o&#8217; Elibank! To-night we shall bring langsyne
back again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were twenty of them, stout and bold men, mounted
upon light and active horses&mdash;some armed with firelocks,
and others with Jeddart staves; while, in addition to such
weapons, every man had a good sword by his side. At
their head was the fearless young laird; and, at a brisk
pace, they set off towards Elibank. Mothers and maidens
ran to their cottage doors, and looked after them with
foreboding hearts when they rode along; for it was a saying
amongst them, that &ldquo;when young Willie Scott o&#8217; Harden
set his foot in the stirrup at night, there were to be swords
drawn before morning.&rdquo; They knew, also, the feud between
him and the house of Elibank, and as well did they know
that the Murrays were a resolute and a sturdy race.</p>

<p>Morn had not dawned when they arrived at the scene
where their booty lay. Not a Murray was abroad; and to
the extreme they carried the threat of the young laird into
execution, of making &ldquo;toom byres.&rdquo; By scores and by
hundreds, they collected together, into one immense herd,
horned cattle and sheep, and they drove them before them
through the forest towards Oakwood Tower. The laird, in
order to repel any rescue that might be attempted, brought
up the rear, and, in the joy of his heart, he sang, and, at
times, cried aloud, &ldquo;There will be dry breakfasts in Elibank
before the sun gets oot, but a merry meal at Oakwood afore
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
he gangs doun. An entire bullock shall be roasted, and
wives and bairns shall eat o&#8217; it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I humbly beg your pardon, Maister William,&rdquo; said an
old retainer, named Simon Scott, and who traced a distant
relationship to the family; &ldquo;I respectfully ask your pardon;
but I have been in your faither&#8217;s family for forty years, and
never was backward in the hoor o&#8217; danger, or in a ploy like
this; but ye will just alloo me to observe, sir, that wilfu&#8217;
waste maks wofu&#8217; want, and I see nae occasion whatever
for roasting a bullock. It would be as bad as oor neebors
on the ither side o&#8217; the Tweed, wha are roast, roastin&#8217;, or
bakin&#8217; in the oven, every day o&#8217; the week, and makin&#8217; a
stane weight o&#8217; meat no gang sae far as twa or three pounds
wad hae dune. Therefore, sir, if ye will tak my advice,
if we are to hae a feast, there will be nae roastin&#8217; in the
way. There was a fine sharp frost the other nicht, and I
observed the rime lying upon the kail; so that baith greens
and savoys will be as tender as a weel-boiled three-month-auld
chicken; and I say, therefore, let the beef be boiled,
and let them hae ladlefu&#8217;s o&#8217; kail, and ye will find, sir, that
instead o&#8217; a hail bullock, even if ye intend to feast auld and
young, male and female, upon the lands o&#8217; Oakwood, a
quarter o&#8217; a bullock will be amply sufficient, and the rest
can be sauted doun for winter&#8217;s provisions. Ye ken, sir,
that the Murrays winna let us lichtly slip for this nicht&#8217;s
wark; and it is aye safest, as the saying is, to lay by for a
sair fit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well argued, good Simon,&rdquo; said the young laird; &ldquo;but
your economy is ill-timed. After a night&#8217;s work such as
this there is surely some licence for gilravishing. I say
it&mdash;and who dare contradict me?&mdash;to-night there is not one
belonging to the house of Harden, be they old or young,
who shall not eat of roast meat, and drink of the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, sir,&rdquo; replied Simon, &ldquo;wi&#8217; reverence be it spoken,
but I would beg to say that ye are wrang. Folk that ance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
get a liking for dainties tak ill wi&#8217; plainer fare again; and,
moreover, sir, in a&#8217; my experience, I never kenned dainty
bits and hardihood to go hand in hand; but, on the contrary,
luxuries mak men effeminate, and discontented into
the bargain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The altercation between the old retainer and his young
master ran farther; but it was suddenly interrupted by the
deep-mouthed baying of a sleuth-hound; and its threatening
howls were followed by a loud cry, as if from fifty
voices, of&mdash;&ldquo;To-night for Sir Gideon and the house of Elibank!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But here we pause to say that Sir Gideon Murray of
Elibank was a man whose name was a sound of terror to
all who were his enemies. As a foe, he was fierce, resolute,
unforgiving. He had never been known to turn his back
upon a foe, or forgive an injury. He knew the meaning of
justice in its severest sense, but not of compassion; he was
a stranger to the attribute of mercy, and the life of the man
who had injured him, he regarded as little as the life of the
worm which he might tread beneath his heel upon his path.
He was a man of middle age; and had three daughters,
none of whom were what the world calls beautiful; but,
on the contrary, they were what even the dependents
upon his estates described as &ldquo;very ordinary-looking young women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such was Sir Gideon Murray of Elibank; and, although
the young laird of Harden conceived that he had come upon
him as &ldquo;a thief in the night&rdquo;&mdash;and some of my readers,
from the transaction recorded, may be somewhat apt to take
the scriptural quotation in a literal sense&mdash;yet I would say,
as old Satchel sings of the Borderers of those days, they
were men&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Somewhat unruly, and very ill to tame.</span><br />
 I would have none think that I call them thieves;<br />
 For, if I did, it would be arrant lies.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p><p>But, stealthily as the young master of Harden had made his
preparations for the foray, old Sir Gideon had got timely
notice of it; and hence it was, that not a Murray seemed
astir when they took the cattle from the byres, and drove
them towards Oakwood. But, through the moonlight,
there were eyes beheld every step they took&mdash;their every
movement was watched and traced; and amongst those
who watched was the stern old knight, with fifty followers
at his back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quiet! quiet!&rdquo; he again and again, in deep murmurs,
uttered to his dependents, throwing back his hand, and
speaking in a deep and earnest whisper, that awed even the
slow but ferocious sleuth-hound that accompanied them,
and caused it to crouch back to his feet. In a yet deeper
whisper, he added, encouragingly&mdash;&ldquo;Patience, my merry
men!&mdash;bide your time!&mdash;ye shall hae work before long go
by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When, therefore, the young laird and his followers began
to disperse in the thickest of the forest, as they drove the
cattle before them, Sir Gideon suddenly exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Now
for the onset!&rdquo; And, at the sound of his voice, the sleuth-hound
howled loud and savagely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are followed!&mdash;Halt! halt!&mdash;to arms! to arms!&rdquo;
cried the heir of Harden.</p>

<p>Three or four were left in charge of the now somewhat
scattered herd of cattle, and to drive them to a distance;
while the rest of the party spurred back their horses as
rapidly as the tangled pass in the forest would permit, to
the spot from whence the voice of their young leader
proceeded. They arrived speedily, but they arrived too
late. In a moment, and with no signal save the baying of the
hound, old Sir Gideon and his armed company had burst
upon young Scott and Old Simon, and ere the former could
cry for assistance, they had surrounded them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Willie Scott! ye rash laddie!&rdquo; cried Sir Gideon&mdash;&ldquo;yield
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
quietly, or a thief&#8217;s death shall ye die; and in the very
forest through which ye have this night driven my cattle,
the corbies and you shall become acquaint&mdash;or, at least, if
ye see not them, they shall see you and feel you too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brag on, ye auld greybeard,&rdquo; exclaimed the youth;
&ldquo;but while a Scott o&#8217; Harden has a finger to wag, no power
on earth shall make his tongue say &lsquo;I am conquered!&rsquo; So
come on!&mdash;do your best&mdash;do your worst&mdash;here is the hand
and the sword to meet ye!&mdash;and were ye ten to one, ye
shall find that Willie Scott isna the lad to turn his back,
though ten full-grown Murrays stand before his face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By my sooth, then, callant,&rdquo; cried the old knight, &ldquo;and
it was small mercy, after what ye hae done, that I intended
to show ye; and after what ye hae said, it shall be less that
I will grant ye. Sae come on lads, and now to humble the
Hardens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arm! every Scott to arms!&rdquo; again shouted the young
laird; &ldquo;and now, Sir Gideon, if ye will measure weapons,
and leave your <em>weel-faured</em> daughters as a legacy to the
world, be it sae. But there are lads among your clan o&#8217;
whom they would hae been glad, and who, belike in <em>pity</em>,
might hae offered them their hands, but who will this night
mak a bride o&#8217; the green sward! Sae come on, Sir Gideon,
and on you and yours be the consequence!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before sunrise,&rdquo; returned Sir Gideon, &ldquo;and the winsome
laird o&#8217; Harden shall boast less vauntingly, and rue
that he had broke his jeers upon an auld man. Touch me,
sir, but not my bairns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conflict began, and on each side the strife was bloody
and desperate. Bold men grasped each other by the throat,
and they held their swords to each other&#8217;s breasts, scowling
one upon another with the ferocity of contending tigers, ere
each gave the deadly plunge which was to hurl both into
eternity. The report of fire-arms, the clash of swords, the
clang of shields, with the neighing of maddened horses, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
lowing of affrighted cattle, the howl of the sleuth-hounds,
and the angry voices of fierce men, mingled wildly together,
and, in one fearful and discordant echo, rang through the
forest. This wild sound was followed by the low melancholy
groans of the dying. But, as I have already stated,
the Scotts, and the cattle which they drove before them,
were scattered, and ere those who were in advance could
arrive to the rescue of their friends in the rear, the latter
were slain, wounded, or overpowered. They also fought
against fearful odds. The young laird himself had his
sword broken in his grasp, and his horse was struck dead
beneath him. He was instantly surrounded and made
prisoner by the Murrays; and, at the same time, old Simon
fell into their hands.</p>

<p>The few remaining retainers of the house of Harden gave
way when they found their leader a captive, and they fled,
leaving the cattle behind them. Sir Gideon Murray, therefore,
recovered all that had been taken from him; and
though he had captured but two prisoners, the one was the
chief, and the other his principal adviser and second in
command. The old knight, therefore, commanded that they
should be bound with cords together, and in such rueful
plight led to his castle at Elibank. It was noon before
they reached it, and Lady Murray came forth to welcome
her husband, and congratulate him upon his success. But
when she beheld the heir of Harden a captive, and thought
of how little mercy was to be expected from Sir Gideon
when once aroused, she remembered that she was a mother,
and that one of her children might one day be situated as
their prisoner then was.</p>

<p>The young laird, with his aged kinsman and dependent,
were thrust into a dark room; and he who locked them up
informed them that the next day their bodies would be
hung up on the nearest tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My life and lang fasting!&rdquo; exclaimed Simon, &ldquo;ye surely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
wouldna be speaking o&#8217; sic a thing as hanging to an auld
man like me. If we were to be shot or beheaded&mdash;though
I would like neither the ane nor the ither&mdash;it wouldna be
a thing in particular to be complained o&#8217;; but to be hanged
like a dog is so disgracefu&#8217; and unchristian-like, that I
would rather die ten times in a day, than feel a hempen
cravat about my neck ance. And, moreover, I must say
that hanging is not treating my dear young maister and
kinsman as he ocht to be treated. His birth, his rank, and
the memory o&#8217; his ancestors and mine, demand mair respect;
and therefore, I say, gae tell your maister, that, if he is
determined that we are to die&mdash;though I have no ambition
to cut my breath before my time&mdash;that I think, as a
gentleman, it is his duty to see that we die the death o&#8217;
gentlemen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence, Simon,&rdquo; cried the young laird; &ldquo;let Murray
hang us in his bedchamber if he will. No matter what
manner o&#8217; death we die, provided only that we die like men.
Let him hang us if he dare, and the disgrace be his that is
coward enough so to make an end of his enemy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O sir,&rdquo; said Simon, &ldquo;but that is poor comfort to a man
that has to leave a small family behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simon! are you afraid to die?&rdquo; cried the captive laird,
in a tone of rebuke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, your honour,&rdquo; said Simon&mdash;&ldquo;that is, I am no more
afraid to die than other men are, or ought to be&mdash;but only
ye&#8217;ll observe, sir, that I have no ambition&mdash;not, as I may
say, to draw my last breath upon a wuddy, but to have it
very unnaturally stopped. Begging your pardon, but you are
a young man, while I have a wife and family that would be
left to mourn for me!&mdash;and O sir! the wife and the bits o&#8217;
bairns press unco sairly upon a man&#8217;s heart, when death
tries to come in the way between him and them. In exploits
like that in which we were last night engaged, and also in
battles abroad, I have faced danger in every shape a hundred
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
times&mdash;yet, sir, to be shot in a moment, as it were, or to be
run through the body, and to die honourably on the field,
is a very different thing from deliberately walking up a
ladder to the branch o&#8217; a tree, from which we are never to
come doun in life again. And mair than that, if we had
been o&#8217; Johnny Faa&#8217;s gang, they couldna hae treated us
mair disrespectfully than to condemn us to the death that
they have decreed for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Providing ye die bravely, Simon,&rdquo; said the young laird,
&ldquo;it is little matter what manner o&#8217; death ye die; and as for
your wife and weans, fear not; my faither&#8217;s house will
provide for them. For, though I fall now, there will be
other heirs left to the estate o&#8217; Harden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the prisoners thus conversed in the place of their
confinement, Lady Murray spoke unto her husband, saying&mdash;&ldquo;And
what, Sir Gideon, if it be a fair question, may ye
intend to do wi&#8217; the braw young laird o&#8217; Harden, now that
he is in your power?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew her gently by the arm towards the window, and
pointing towards a tree which grew at the distance of a few
yards, he said&mdash;&ldquo;Do ye see yonder branch o&#8217; the elm tree
that is waving in the wind? To-morrow, young Scott and
his kinsman shall swing there together, or hereafter say that
I am no Murray.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O guidman!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it is because I was terrified
that ye would be doing the like o&#8217; that, that caused me
to ask the question. Now, I must say, Sir Gideon, whatever
ye may think, that ye are not only acting cruelly, but
foolishly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I care naething about the cruelty,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;what
mercy did ever a Scott among them show to me or to mine?
Lady Murray, the ball is at my foot, and I will kick it,
though I deprive Scott o&#8217; Harden o&#8217; a head. And what
mean ye, dame, by saying I act foolishly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only this, guidman,&rdquo; said she&mdash;&ldquo;that ye hae three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
daughters to marry, whom the world doesna consider to
be ower weel-faured, and it isna every day that ye hae a
husband for ane o&#8217; them in your hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sooth!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;and for once in your life ye are
right, guidwife&mdash;there is mair wisdom in that remark than
I would hae gien ye credit for. To-morrow, the birkie
o&#8217; Harden shall have his choice&mdash;either upon the instant
to marry our daughter, Meikle-mouthed Meg, or strap
for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, Sir Gideon,&rdquo; added she, &ldquo;to make him marry
Meg will be mair purpose-like than to cut off the head and
the hope of an auld house, in the very flower o&#8217; his youth;
and there is nae doubt as to the choice he will mak, for
there is an unco difference between them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dinna be ower sure,&rdquo; continued the knight; &ldquo;there is
nae saying what his choice may be. There is both pluck
and a spirit o&#8217; contradiction in the callant, and I wouldna
be in the least surprised if he preferred the wuddy. I
ken, had I been in his place, what my choice would hae
been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay, Sir Gideon,&rdquo; replied the old lady, who
was jocose at the idea of seeing one of her daughters
wed, &ldquo;I daresay I could guess what that choice would hae been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what, in your wisdom,&rdquo; said he sharply, &ldquo;do ye
think it would hae been&mdash;the wife or the wuddy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Gideon! Gideon!&rdquo; said she, good-humouredly, and
shaking her head, &ldquo;weel do ye ken that your choice would
hae been a wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There ye are wrang,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;I would rather die a
death that was before me, than marry a wife I had never
seen. But go ye and prepare Meg for becoming a bride
the morn, and I shall see what the intended bridegroom
says to the proposal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In obedience to his commands, she went to an apartment
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
in which their eldest daughter Agnes, but commonly called
&ldquo;Meikle-mouthed Meg,&rdquo; then sat, twirling a distaff. The
old dame sat down by her daughter&#8217;s side, and, after a few
observations respecting the weather, and the quality of
the lint she was then torturing into threads, she said&mdash;&ldquo;Weel,
I&#8217;m just thinking, Meggie, that ye mak me an
auld woman. Ye would be six-and-twenty past at last
Lammas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I believe, mother!&rdquo; said Meggie; and a sigh, or a
very deep and long-drawn breath, followed her words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; continued the old lady, &ldquo;young men maun
be growing very scarce. I wanted four months and five
days o&#8217; being nineteen when I married your faither, and I
had refused at least six offers before I took him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, mother,&rdquo; replied the maiden; &ldquo;but ye had a weel-faured
face&mdash;there lay the difference! Heigho!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heigho!&rdquo; responded her mother, as in pleasant raillery&mdash;&ldquo;what
is the lassie heighoing at? Certes, if ye get a
guidman before ye be six and twenty, ye may think yoursel&#8217;
a very fortunate woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added the maiden; &ldquo;but I see sma&#8217; prospect o&#8217;
that. I doubt ye will see the Ettrick running through the
&lsquo;dowie dells o&#8217; Yarrow,&rsquo; before ye hear tell o&#8217; an offer being
made to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hoot, hoot!&mdash;dinna say sae, bairn,&rdquo; added her mother;
&ldquo;there is nae saying what may betide ye yet. Ye think
ye winna be married before ye are six and twenty; but,
truly, my dear, there has mony a mair unlikely ship come
to land. Now, what wad ye think o&#8217; the young laird o&#8217;
Harden?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother! mother!&rdquo; said Agnes, &ldquo;wherefore do ye
mock me? I never saw ye do that before. My faither
has ta&#8217;en William Scott a prisoner; and, from what I hae
heard, he will hang him in the morning. Ye ken what a
man my faither is&mdash;when he says a thing he will do it; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
how can you jest about the young man, when his very
existence is reduced to a matter o&#8217; minutes and moments.
Though, rather than my faither should tak his life, if I
could save him, he should take mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel said, my bairn,&rdquo; replied the old woman; &ldquo;but
dinna ye be put about concerning what will never come to
pass. I doubtna that, before morning, ye will find young
Scott o&#8217; Harden at your feet, and begging o&#8217; you to save
his life, by giving him your hand and troth, and becoming
his wife: and then, ye ken, your faither couldna, for shame,
hang or do ony harm to his ain son-in-law.&ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O mother! mother!&rdquo; replied Agnes, &ldquo;it will never be
in my power to save him; for what ye hae said he will never
think o&#8217;; and even if I were his wife, I question if my
faither would pardon him, though I should beg it upon my
knees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, your faither&#8217;s no sae ill as that, Meggie, my doo,&rdquo;
said the old lady. &ldquo;Mark my words&mdash;if Willie Scott consent
to marry you, ye will henceforth find him and your
faither hand and glove.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While this conversation between Lady Murray and her
daughter took place, Sir Gideon entered the room where
his prisoners were confined, and, addressing the young
laird, said&mdash;&ldquo;Now, ye rank marauder, though death is the
very least that ye deserve or can expect from my hands, yet
I will gie ye a chance for your life, and ye shall choose
between a wife and the wuddy. To-morrow morning, ye
shall either marry my daughter Meg, or swing from the
branch o&#8217; the nearest tree, and the bauldest Scott upon the
Borders shanna tak ye down, until ye drop away, bone by
bone, a fleshless skeleton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good save us! most honourable and good Sir Gideon!&rdquo;
suddenly interrupted Simon, in a tone which bespoke his
horror; &ldquo;but ye certainly dinna intend to make an anatomy
o&#8217; me too; or surely, when my honoured maister marries
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Miss Murray (as I hope and trust he will), ye will alloo me
to dance at their wedding, instead o&#8217; dancing in the air, and
keeping time to the music o&#8217; the soughing wind. And, O
maister! for my sake, for your ain sake, and especially out
o&#8217; regard to my sma&#8217; and helpless family, consent to marry
the lassie, though she isna extraordinar&#8217; weel-faured; for I
am sure that, rather than die a dog&#8217;s death, swinging from
a tree, I would marry twenty wives, though they were a&#8217;
as auld as the hills, as ugly as a starless midnicht, and had
tongues like trumpets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace, Simon!&rdquo; cried the young laird, impatiently;
&ldquo;if ye hae turned coward, keep the sound o&#8217; yer fears
within yer ain teeth. And ye, Sir Gideon,&rdquo; added he,
turning towards the old knight, &ldquo;in your amazing mercy
and generosity, would spare my life, upon condition that I
should marry your <em>bonny</em> daughter Meg! Look ye, sir&mdash;I
am Scott o&#8217; Harden, and ye are Murray o&#8217; Elibank; there
is no love lost between us; chance has placed my life in
your hands&mdash;take it, for I wouldna marry your daughter
though ye should gie me life, and a&#8217; the lands o&#8217; Elibank
into the bargain. I fear as little to meet death as I do to
tell you to your teeth that, had ye fallen into my hands, I
would have hung ye wi&#8217; as little ceremony as I would bring
a whip across the back o&#8217; a disobedient hound. Therefore,
ye are welcome to do the same by me. Ye have taken
what ye thought to be a sure mode o&#8217; getting a husband
for ane o&#8217; your <em>winsome</em> daughters; but, in the present
instance, it has proved a wrong one, auld man. Do your
worst, and there will be Scotts enow left to revenge the
death o&#8217; the laird o&#8217; Harden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, then, is my thumb, young braggart,&rdquo; exclaimed
Sir Gideon, &ldquo;that I winna hinder ye in your choice; for
to-morrow ye shall be exalted as Haman was; and let
those revenge your death who dare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maister!&mdash;dear maister!&rdquo; cried Simon, wringing his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
hands, &ldquo;will ye sacrifice me also, and break the hearts o&#8217;
my puir wife and family! O sir, accept o&#8217; Sir Gideon&#8217;s
proposal, and marry his dochter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence! ye milk-livered slave!&rdquo; cried the young laird.
&ldquo;Do ye pretend to bear the name o&#8217; Scott, and yet tremble
like an ash leaf at the thought o&#8217; death!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye will excuse me, sir,&rdquo; retorted Simon, &ldquo;but I tremble
at no such thing; only, as I have already remarked, I have
no particular ambition for being honoured wi&#8217; the exaltation
o&#8217; the halter; and, moreover, I see no cause why a
man should die unnecessarily, or where death can be
avoided. Sir Gideon,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;humble prisoner as I
at this moment am, and in your power, I leave it to you if
ever ye saw ony thing in my conduct in the field o&#8217; battle
(and ye have seen me there) that could justify ony ane in
calling me either milk-livered or a coward? But, sir, I
consider it would be altogether unjustifiable to deprive ane
o&#8217; life, which is always precious, merely because my maister
is stubborn, and winna marry your daughter. But, oh,
sir, I am not a very auld man yet, and if ye will set
me at liberty, though I am now a married man, in the
event o&#8217; my ever becoming a widower, I gie ye my solemn
promise that I will marry ony o&#8217; your dochters that ye
please!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Audacious idiot!&rdquo; exclaimed the old knight, raising his
hand and striking poor Simon to the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Gideon Murray!&rdquo; cried the young laird fiercely,
&ldquo;are ye such a base knave as to strike a fettered prisoner!
Shame fa&#8217; ye, man! where is the pride o&#8217; the Murrays
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Gideon evidently felt the rebuke, and, withdrawing
from the apartment, said, as he departed&mdash;&ldquo;Remember
that when the sun-dial shall to-morrow note the hour of
twelve, so surely shall ye be brought forth&mdash;and a wife
shall be your lot, or the wuddy your doom.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
&ldquo;Leave me!&rdquo; cried the youth impatiently, &ldquo;and the
gallows be it&mdash;my choice is made. Till my last hour trouble
me not again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir! sir!&rdquo; cried Simon, &ldquo;I beg, I pray that ye will
alter your determination. There is surely naething so awful
in the idea o&#8217; marriage, even though your wife should have
a face not particularly weel-favoured. Ye dinna ken, sir,
but that the young woman&#8217;s looks are her worst fault; and,
indeed, I hae heard her spoken o&#8217; as a lassie o&#8217; great sense
and discretion, and as having an excellent temper; and, oh,
sir, if ye kenned as weel what it is to be married as I do,
ye would think that a good temper was a recommendation
far before beauty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold thy fool&#8217;s tongue, Simon,&rdquo; cried the laird;
&ldquo;would ye disgrace the family wi&#8217; which ye make it
your boast to be connected, when in the power and presence
o&#8217; its enemies? Do as ye see me do&mdash;die and defy
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was drawing towards midnight, when the prison-door
was opened, and the sentinel who stood watch over it
admitted a female dressed as a domestic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What want ye, or whom seek ye, maiden?&rdquo; inquired
the laird.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I come,&rdquo; answered she mildly, &ldquo;to speak wi&#8217; the laird
o&#8217; Harden, and to ask if he has any dying commands that
a poor lassie could fulfil for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dying commands!&rdquo; responded Simon; &ldquo;oh, are those
no awful words!&mdash;and can ye still be foolhardy enough to
say ye winna marry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who sent ye, maiden?&mdash;or who are ye?&rdquo; continued
the laird.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A despised lassie, sir,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;and an attendant
upon Sir Gideon&#8217;s lady, in whom ye hae a true and
steadfast friend; though I doubt that, as ye hae refused
poor Meg, her intercession will avail ye little.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
&ldquo;And wherefore has Lady Murray sent you here?&rdquo; he
continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just, sir, because she is a mother, and has a mother&#8217;s
heart; and, as ye hae a mother and sisters who will now
be mourning for ye at Oakwood, she thought that, belike,
ye would hae something to say that ye would wish to hae
communicated to them; and, if it be sae, I am come to
offer to be your messenger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maiden!&rdquo; said he, with emotion, &ldquo;speak not of my
poor mother, or you will unman me, and I would wish to
die as becomes my father&#8217;s son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s right, hinny,&rdquo; whispered Simon; &ldquo;speak to
him about his mother again&mdash;talk about her sorrow, poor
lady, and her tears, and distraction, and mourning&mdash;and I
hae little doubt but that we shall get him to marry Meg,
or do onything else, and I shall get back to my family
after a&#8217;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it that ye whisper, Simon, in the maiden&#8217;s ear?&rdquo;
inquired the laird, sternly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, naething, sir&mdash;naething, I assure ye,&rdquo; answered
Simon, falteringly; &ldquo;I was only saying that, if ye sent
her ower to Oakwood wi&#8217; a message to your poor, honoured,
wretched mother, that she would inquire for my
poor widow, Janet, and my bits o&#8217; bairns, and that she
would tell them that nothing troubled me upon my
death-bed&mdash;no, no, not my death-bed, but&mdash;I declare I am
ashamed to think o&#8217;t!&mdash;I was saying that I was simply
telling her to inform my wife and bairns, that nothing distracted
me in the hour o&#8217; death but the thought o&#8217; being
parted from them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without noticing the evasive reply of his dependent and
fellow-prisoner, the laird, addressing the intruder, said&mdash;&ldquo;Ye
speak as a kind and considerate lassie. I would like
to send a scrape o&#8217; a pen to my poor mother, and, if ye
will be its bearer, she will reward ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
&ldquo;And, belike,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;ye would like to hear if
the good lady has an answer back, or to learn how she
bore the tidings o&#8217; your unhappy fate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before you could return,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the time appointed
by my adversary for my execution will be past,
and I shall feel for my mother&#8217;s sorrows with the sympathy
of a disembodied spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; added she, &ldquo;if you would like to hear from
your poor mother, or, belike, to see her&mdash;for there may be
family matters that ye would wish to have arranged&mdash;I
think, through the influence of my lady, Sir Gideon could
be prevailed upon to grant ye a respite for three or four
days; and, as he isna a man that keeps his passion long,
perhaps by that time he may be disposed to save your
life upon terms that would be more acceptable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, maiden,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;he is my enemy; and from
him I wish no terms&mdash;no clemency. Let him fulfil his
purpose&mdash;I will die; but my death shall be revenged;
and tell my mother that it was my latest injunction that
she should command every follower of our house to avenge
her son&#8217;s death, while there is a Murray left in all Scotland
to repent the deed o&#8217; the knight o&#8217; Elibank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sweet young ma&#8217;am, or mistress!&rdquo; cried Simon;
&ldquo;bear the lady no such message; but rather, as ye hae
said, try if it be possible to get your own good lady to
persuade Sir Gideon to spare our lives for a few days;
and, as ye say, the edge o&#8217; the auld knight&#8217;s revenge may
be blunted by that time, or, perhaps, my worthy young
maister may be brought to see things in a clearer light,
and, perhaps, to marry Miss Margaret, by which means
our lives may be spared. For it is certainly the height o&#8217;
madness in him to sacrifice my life and his own, rather
than marry her before he has seen her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simon,&rdquo; interrupted the laird, &ldquo;the maiden has spoken
kindly; let her endeavour to procure a respite&mdash;a reprieve
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
for you. In your death my enemy can have no gratification;
but for me&mdash;leave me to myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O sir,&rdquo; replied Simon, &ldquo;ye wrong me&mdash;ye mistake my
meaning a&#8217;thegither. If you are to die, I will die also;
but do ye no think it would be as valorous, and mair
rational, at least to see and hear the young leddy before
ye determine to die rather than to marry her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And hae ye,&rdquo; said the maiden, addressing the laird,
&ldquo;preferred the gallows to poor Meg without even seeing her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I haena seen her I hae heard o&#8217; her,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;and by all accounts her countenance isna ane that ony
man would desire to see accompanying him through the
world like a shadow at his oxter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Belike,&rdquo; said the maiden, &ldquo;she has been represented
to you worse than she looks like&mdash;if ye saw her, ye might
change your opinion; and, perhaps, after a&#8217;, that she isna
bonny is a&#8217; that any one can say against her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wheesht, lassie!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I winna be forced to
onything. A Scott may be led, but he winna drive. I
have nae wish to see the face o&#8217; your young mistress, for I
winna hae her. But you speak as one that has a feeling
heart, and before I trust ye wi&#8217; my last letter to my poor
mother, I should like to have a glance at your face, and by
your countenance I shall judge whether or not it will be
safe to trust ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt, sir,&rdquo; replied she, throwing back the hood that
covered her head, &ldquo;ye will see as little in my features as
ye expect to find in my young mistress&#8217;s to recommend
me; but, sir, you ought to remember that jewels are often
encrusted in coarser metals, and ye will often find a delicious
kernel within an unsightly shell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye speak sweetly, and as sensibly as sweet,&rdquo; said he,
raising the flickering lamp, which burned before them
upon a small table, and gazing upon her countenance;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
&ldquo;and I will now tell ye, lassie, that if your features be not
beautiful, there is honesty and kindliness written upon
every line o&#8217; them; and though ye are a dependent in the
house o&#8217; my enemy, I will trust ye. Try if I can obtain
writing materials to address a few lines to my mother, and
I will confide in you to deliver them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye may confide in me,&rdquo; rejoined she, &ldquo;and the writing
materials which ye desire I hae brought wi&#8217; me.
Write, and not only shall your letter be faithfully delivered,
but, as ye hae confided in me, I will venture to say
that your life shall be spared until ye receive her answer;
for I may say that what I request, Lady Murray will try to
see performed. And if I can find any means in my power
by which ye can escape, it shall not be lang that ye will
remain a prisoner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank ye!&mdash;doubly thank ye!&rdquo; cried Simon; &ldquo;ye
are a good and a kind creature; and though my maister
refuses to marry your mistress, yet, had I been single, I
would hae married you. But, oh, when ye go wi&#8217; the
letter to his mother, my honoured lady, will ye just go
away down to a bit white house which lies by the river
side, about a mile and a half aboon Selkirk, and there ye
will find my poor wife and bairns&mdash;or rather, I should say,
my unhappy widow and my orphans&mdash;and tell them&mdash;oh,
tell my wife&mdash;that I never kenned how dear she was to
me till now; but that, if she marries again, my ghost
will haunt her night and day; and tell also the bairns that,
above everything, I charge them to be good to their mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young laird sat down, and, writing a letter to his
mother, intrusted it to the hands of the stranger girl. He
raised her hand to his lips as she withdrew, and a tear
trickled down his cheeks as he thanked her.</p>

<p>It was early on the following morning that Meikle-mouthed
Meg, as she was called, requested an interview
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
with her father, which being granted, after respectfully
rendering obeisance before him, she said&mdash;&ldquo;So, faither, I
understand that it is your pleasure that I shall this day
become the wife o&#8217; young Scott o&#8217; Harden. I think, sir,
that it is due to the daughter o&#8217; a Murray o&#8217; Elibank, that
she should be courted before she gies her hand. The
young man has never seen me; he kens naething concerning
me; an&#8217; never will yer dochter disgrace ye by gieing
her hand to a man who only accepted it to save his neck
from a hempen cord. Faither, if it be your command that
I am to marry him, I will an&#8217; must marry him; but, before
I just make a venture upon him for better for worse, an&#8217;
for life, I wad like to hae some sma&#8217; acquaintance wi&#8217; him,
to see what sort o&#8217; a lad he is, and what kind o&#8217; temper he
has; and therefore, faither, I humbly crave that ye will
put off the death or the marriage for a week at least, that
I may hae an opportunity o&#8217; judging for mysel&#8217; how far it
would be prudent or becoming in me to consent to be his
wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gie me your hand, Meg,&rdquo; cried the old knight; &ldquo;I
didna think ye had as muckle spirit and gumption in ye
as to say what ye hae said. But your request is useless;
for he has already, point blank, refused to hae ye; an&#8217;
there is naething left for him, but, before sunset, to strike
his heels against the bark o&#8217; the auld elm tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say not that, faither,&rdquo; said she&mdash;&ldquo;let me at least hae
four days to become acquainted wi&#8217; him; and if in that
time he doesna mak a request to you to marry me without
ony dowry, then will I say that I look even waur than I
get the name o&#8217; doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He shall have four days, Meg,&rdquo; cried the old knight;
&ldquo;for your sake he will have them; but if, at the end o&#8217;
four days, he shall refuse to take ye, he shall hang before
this window, and his poor half-crazed companion shall bear
him company.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
With this assurance Agnes, or, as she was called, Meg
left her father, and bethought her of how she might save
the prisoners and secure a husband.</p>

<p>The mother of the laird sat in the midst of her
daughters, mourning for him, and looking from the window
of the tower, as though, in every form that appeared
in the distance, she expected to see him, or at least to
gather tidings regarding him, when information was
brought to her that he was the prisoner of Murray of
Elibank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; cried she, and wept, &ldquo;the days o&#8217; my winsome
Willie are numbered, and his death is determined on; for
often has Sir Gideon declared he would gie a&#8217; the lands o&#8217;
Elibank for his head. My Willie is my only son, my
first-born, and my heart&#8217;s hope and treasure; and, oh, if
I lose him now, if I shall never again hear his kindly
voice say &lsquo;<em>mother</em>!&rsquo; nor stroke down his yellow hair&mdash;wi&#8217;
him that has made me sonless I shall hae a day o&#8217;
lang and fearfu&#8217; reckoning; cauld shall be the hearth-stane
in the house o&#8217; many a Murray, and loud their
lamentation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her daughters wept with her for their brother&#8217;s fate;
but they wist not how to comfort her; and, while they
sat mingling their tears together, it was announced to them
that a humble maiden, bearing a message from the captive
laird, desired to speak with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show her in!&mdash;take me to her!&rdquo; cried the mother,
impatiently. &ldquo;Where is she?&mdash;what does she say?&mdash;or
what does my Willie say?&rdquo; And the maiden who has
been mentioned as having visited the laird in his prison,
was ushered into her presence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come to me, lassie&mdash;come and tell me a&#8217;,&rdquo; cried the
old lady; &ldquo;what message does Willie Scott send to his
heart-broken mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has sent you this bit packet, ma&#8217;am,&rdquo; replied the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
bearer; &ldquo;and I shall be right glad to take back to him
whatever answer ye may hae to send.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And wha are ye, young woman?&rdquo; inquired the lady,
&ldquo;that speaks sae kindly to a mother, an&#8217; takes an interest
in the fate o&#8217; my Willie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A despised lassie,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;but ane that
would risk her ain life to save either yours or his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless you for the words!&rdquo; replied Lady Scott, as she
broke the seal of her son&#8217;s letter, and read:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother, my honoured mother,&mdash;Fate has delivered
me into the power of Murray of Elibank, the enemy of our
house. He has doomed me to death, and I die to-morrow;
but sit not down to mourn for me, and uselessly to wring
the hands and tear the hair; but rouse every Scott upon
the Borders to rise up and be my avenger. If ye bewail
the loss o&#8217; a son, let them spare o&#8217; the Murrays neither son
nor daughter. Rouse ye, and let a mother&#8217;s vengeance
nerve your arm! Poor Simon o&#8217; Yarrow-foot is to be my
companion in death, and he whines to meet his fate with
the weakness of a woman, and yearns a perpetual yearning
for his wife and bairns. On that account I forgie him the
want o&#8217; heart and determination which he manifests; but
see ye to them, and take care that they be provided for.
As for me, I shall meet my doom wi&#8217; disdain for my enemy
in my eyes and on my tongue. Even in death he shall feel
that I despise him; and a proof o&#8217; this I have given him
already; for he has offered to save my life, providing I
would marry his daughter, Meikle-mouthed Meg. But I
have scorned his proposal.&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye were right, Willie! ye were right, lad!&rdquo; exclaimed
his mother, while the letter shook in her hand; but, suddenly
bursting into tears, she continued&mdash;&ldquo;No, no! my
bairn was wrong&mdash;very wrong. Life is precious, and at
all times desirable; and, for his poor mother&#8217;s sake, he
ought to have married the lassie, whate&#8217;er she may be like.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
And, turning to the bearer of the letter, she inquired&mdash;&ldquo;And
what like may the leddy be, the marrying o&#8217; whom
would save my Willie&#8217;s life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye have nae doubt heard, my leddy,&rdquo; replied the
stranger, &ldquo;that she isna what the world considers to be a
likely lass&mdash;though, take her as she is, and ye might find a
hantle worse wives than poor Meg would make; and, as to
her features, I may say that she looks much the same as
I do; and if she doesna appear better, she at least doesna
look ony waur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, if she be as ye say, and look as ye say,&rdquo; continued
the lady, &ldquo;my poor headstrong Willie ought to
marry her. But, oh! weel do I ken that in everything
he is just his father ower again, and ye might as weel
think o&#8217; moving the Eildon hills as force him to onything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She perused the concluding part o&#8217; her son&#8217;s letter, in
which he spoke enthusiastically of the kindness shown him
by the fair messenger, and of the promise she had made to
liberate him if possible. &ldquo;And if she does,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;whatever be her parentage, on the day that I should be
free, she should be my wife, though I have preferred death
to the hand o&#8217; Sir Gideon&#8217;s <em>comely</em> daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lassie,&rdquo; said the lady, weeping as she spoke, &ldquo;my
poor Willie talks a deal o&#8217; the kindness ye have shown him
in the hour o&#8217; his distress, and for that kindness his mother&#8217;s
heart thanks ye. But do you not think that it is possible
that I could accompany ye to Elibank? and, if ye can devise
no means for him to escape, perhaps, if ye could get me
admitted into his presence, when he saw his poor distressed
mother upon her knees before him, his heart would saften,
and he would marry Sir Gideon&#8217;s daughter, ill-featured
though she may be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My leddy,&rdquo; answered the stranger maiden, &ldquo;it is little
that I can promise, and less that I can do; but if ye desire
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
to see yer son, I think I could answer for accomplishing yer
request; an&#8217; though nae guid micht come oot o&#8217;t, I could
also say that I wad see ye safe back again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Within an hour, Lady Scott, disguised as a peasant, and
carrying a basket on her arm, set out for Elibank, accompanied
by the fair stranger.</p>

<p>Leaving them upon their melancholy journey, we shall
return to the young laird. From the windows of his
prison-house, he beheld the sun rise which was to be the
last on which he was to look. He heard the sentinels,
who kept watch over him, relieve each other; he heard
them pacing to and fro before the grated door, and as the
sun rose towards the south, proclaiming the approach of
noon, the agitation of Simon increased. He sat in a corner
of the prison, and strove to pray; and, as the footsteps
of the sentinels quickened, he groaned in the bitterness
of his spirit. At length the loud booming of the
gong announced that the dial-plate upon the turret marked
the hour of twelve. Simon clasped his hands together.
&ldquo;Maister! maister!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;our hour is come, an&#8217; one
word from yer lips could save us baith, an&#8217; ye winna speak
it. The very holding oot o&#8217; yer hand could do it, but ye
are stubborn even unto death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simon,&rdquo; said the laird, &ldquo;I hae left it as an injunction
upon my mother, that yer wife an&#8217; weans be provided for&mdash;she
will fulfil my request. Therefore, be ye content.
Die like a man, an&#8217; dinna disgrace both yourself an&#8217; me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O sir! I winna disgrace, or in any manner dishonour
ye,&rdquo; said Simon&mdash;&ldquo;only I do not see the smallest necessity
for us to die, and especially when both our lives could be
saved by yer doing yerself a good turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While he spoke, the sound of the sentinels&#8217; footsteps,
pacing to and fro, ceased. The prison-door was opened;
Simon fell upon his knees&mdash;the laird looked towards the
intruder proudly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
&ldquo;Your lives are spared for another day,&rdquo; said a voice,
&ldquo;that the laird o&#8217; Harden may have time to reflect upon
the proposal that has been made to him. But let him
not hope that he will find mercy upon other terms; or
that, refusing them for another day, his life will be prolonged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door was again closed, and the bolts were drawn.
The spirit of Sir Gideon was too proud and impatient to
spare the lives of his prisoners for four days, as he had
promised to his daughter to do, and he now resolved that
they should die upon the following day.</p>

<p>The sun had again set, and the dim lamp shed around
its fitful and shadowy lights from the table of the prison-room,
when the maiden, who had carried the letter to the
laird&#8217;s mother, again entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is kind, very kind, gentle maiden,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;would that I could reward ye! An&#8217; hoo fares it with
my puir mother?&mdash;what answer does she send?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&#8217; oh, ma&#8217;am, or mistress!&rdquo; cried Simon, &ldquo;hoo fares
it wi&#8217; my dear wife an&#8217; bairns? I hope ye told them all
that I desired ye to say. Hoo did she bear the news o&#8217;
being made a widow? An&#8217; what did she say to my injunction
that she was never to marry again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye talk wildly, man,&rdquo; said the maiden, addressing
Simon; &ldquo;it wasna in my power to carry yer commands to
yer wife; but, I trust, it will be longer than ye expect
before she will be a widow, or hae it in her power to
marry again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O ye angel! ye perfect picture!&rdquo; cried Simon, &ldquo;what
is that which I hear ye say? Do ye really mean to tell
me that I stand a chance o&#8217; being saved, an&#8217; that I shall
see my wife an&#8217; bairns again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;but whether ye do or do not,
rests with yer master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak not o&#8217; that, sweet maiden,&rdquo; said the laird;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
&ldquo;but tell me, what says my mother? How does she bear
the fate o&#8217; her son; an&#8217; hoo does she promise to avenge
my death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is as one whose heart-strings are torn asunder,&rdquo;
was the reply, &ldquo;and who refuses to be comforted; but
she wad rather hae another dochter than lose an only
son; an&#8217; her prayer is, that ye will live and mak her
happy, by marrying the maiden ye despise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;has even my mother so far forgot
herself as to desire me to marry the dochter o&#8217; oor enemy,
whom no other man could be found to take! It shall
never be. I wad obey her in onything but that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the maiden, &ldquo;I still think ye are wrong to
reject and despise puir Meg before that ye hae seen her.
She may baith be better an&#8217; look better than ye are aware
o&#8217;. There are as guid as Scott o&#8217; Harden who hae said,
that were it in their power they wad mak her their wife;
an&#8217; ye should remember, sir, that it will be as pleasant for
you to hear the blithe laverock singing ower yer head, as
for another person to hear the wind soughing and the long
grass rustling ower yer grave. Ye hae another day to
live, an&#8217; see her, an&#8217; speak to her, before ye decide rashly.
Yours is a cruel doom, but Sir Gideon is a wrathfu&#8217; man;
an&#8217; even for his ain flesh an&#8217; bluid he has but sma&#8217; compassion
when his anger is provoked. Death, too, is an
awfu&#8217; thing to think aboot; an&#8217;, therefore, for yer ain sake,
an&#8217; for the sake o&#8217; yer puir distressed mother an&#8217; sisters,
dinna come to a rash determination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sweet lass,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;I respect the sympathy which
ye evince; but never shall Sir Gideon Murray say that, in
order to save my life, he terrified me into a marriage wi&#8217;
his daughter. An&#8217; when my puir mother&#8217;s grief has subsided,
she will think differently o&#8217; my decision.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, sir,&rdquo; said the maiden, &ldquo;since ye will not listen
to my advice&mdash;an&#8217; I own that I hae nae richt to offer it&mdash;I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
will send ane to ye whose persuasion will hae mair
avail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom will ye send?&rdquo; inquired the laird; &ldquo;it isna
possible that ye can hae been playing me false?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;that isna possible; an&#8217; from her
that I will send to you, you will see whether or not I hae
kept my word, guid and truly, to fulfil yer message.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, she withdrew, leaving him much wondering
at her words, and yet more at the interest which she took
in his fate. But she had not long withdrawn when the
prison-door was again opened, and Lady Scott rushed into
the arms of her son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother!&rdquo; cried he, starting back in astonishment&mdash;&ldquo;my
mother!&mdash;hoo is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, joy an&#8217; gladness, an&#8217; every blessing be upon my
honoured lady! for noo I may stand some chance o&#8217;
walkin&#8217; back upon my ain feet to see my family. Oh!
yer leddyship,&rdquo; Simon added, &ldquo;join yer prayers to my
prayers, an&#8217; try if ye can persuade my maister to marry
Sir Gideon&#8217;s dochter, an&#8217; thereby save baith his life an&#8217;
mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she fell upon the neck of her son, and seemed not
to hear the words which Simon addressed to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O my son! my son!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;since there is no
other way by which yer life can be ransomed, yield to the
demand o&#8217; the fierce Murray. Marry his daughter an&#8217; live&mdash;save
yer wretched mother&#8217;s life; for yer death, Willie,
wad be mine also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; answered he, vehemently, &ldquo;I will never
accept life upon such terms. I am in Murray&#8217;s hands, but
the day may come&mdash;yea, see ye that it does come&mdash;when
he shall fall into the hands o&#8217; the Scotts o&#8217; Harden; an&#8217; see
ye that ye do to him as he shall have done to me. But,
tell me, mother, hoo are ye here? Wherefore did ye
venture, or hoo got ye permission to see me? Ken ye not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
that if he found ye in his power, upon your life also he
wad fix a ransom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The kind lassie,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;that brought the letter
from ye, at my request conducted me here, and contrived
to get me permission to see ye; an&#8217; she says that my visit
shall not come to the knowledge o&#8217; Sir Gideon. But, O
Willie! as ye love an&#8217; respect the mother that bore ye,
an&#8217; that nursed ye nicht an&#8217; day at her bosom, dinna throw
awa yer life when it is in yer power to save it, but marry
Miss Murray, an&#8217; ye may live, an&#8217; so may I, to see many
happy days; for, from a&#8217; that I hae heard, though not
weel-favoured, she is a young lady o&#8217; an excellent disposition!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&#8217;s richt, my leddy,&rdquo; interrupted Simon;
&ldquo;urge him to marry her, for it would be a dreadfu&#8217; thing
for him an&#8217; I to be gibbeted, as a pair o&#8217; perpetual spectacles
for the Murrays to mak a jest o&#8217;. Ye ken if he does
marry, an&#8217; if he finds he doesna like her, he can leave her;
or he needna live wi&#8217; her; or, perhaps, she may soon die;
an&#8217; ye will certainly agree that marriage, ony way ye tak
it, is to be desired, a thousand times ower, before a violent
death. Therefore, urge him again, yer leddyship, for he
may listen to what ye say, though he despises my words,
an&#8217; will not hearken to my advice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simon,&rdquo; said the laird, &ldquo;never shall a Murray hae it
in his power to boast that he struck terror into the breast
o&#8217; a Scott o&#8217; Harden. My determination is fixed as fate.
I shall welcome my doom, an&#8217; meet it as a man. Come,
dear mother,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;weep not, nor cause me to
appear in the presence o&#8217; my enemies with a blanched
cheek. Hasten to avenge my death, an&#8217; think that in yer
revenge yer son lives again. Come, though I die, there
will be moonlight again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hung upon his breast and wept, but he turned
away his head and refused to listen to her entreaties.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
The young maiden again entered the prison, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye must part noo, for in a few minutes Sir Gideon
will be astir, an&#8217; should he find yer leddyship here, or discover
that I hae brought ye, I wad hae sma&#8217; power to gie
ye protection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fareweel, dear mother!&mdash;fareweel!&rdquo; exclaimed the
youth, grasping her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Willie! Willie!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;did I bear ye to see
ye come to an end like this! Bairn! bairn! live&mdash;for yer
mother&#8217;s sake, live!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fareweel, mother!&mdash;fareweel!&rdquo; he again cried, and
the sentinel conducted her from the apartment.</p>

<p>It again drew towards noon. The loud gong again
sounded, and Simon sank upon his knees in despair, as the
voice of the warder was heard crying&mdash;&ldquo;It is the hour!
prepare the prisoners for execution!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the prison-door was opened, and Sir Gideon, with
wrath upon his brow, stood before them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, youngster,&rdquo; said he, addressing the laird, &ldquo;yer
hour is come. What is yer choice&mdash;a wife or the wuddy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lead me to execution, ye auld knave,&rdquo; answered the
laird, scornfully; &ldquo;an&#8217; ken, that wi&#8217; the hemp around my
neck, in contempt o&#8217; you an&#8217; yours, I will spit upon the
ground where ye tread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, guards!&rdquo; cried Sir Gideon; &ldquo;lead forth William
Scott o&#8217; Harden to execution. Strap him upon the
nearest tree, an&#8217; there let him hang until the bauldest
Scott upon the Borders dare to cut him down. As for
you,&rdquo; added he, addressing Simon, &ldquo;I seek not your life;
depart, ye are free; but beware hoo ye again fall into the
hands o&#8217; Gideon Murray.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Simon, &ldquo;though I am free to
acknowledge that I hae nae ambition to die before it is the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
wise will an&#8217; purpose o&#8217; nature, yet I winna, I canna leave
my dear young maister; an&#8217; if he be to suffer, I will share
his fate. Only, Sir Gideon, there is ae thing I hae to say,
an&#8217; that is, that he is young, an&#8217; he is proud an&#8217; stubborn,
like yersel&#8217;, an&#8217; though he will not, o&#8217; his ain free will an&#8217;
accord, nor in obedience to yer commandments, marry yer
dochter&mdash;is it not possible to compel him, whether he be
willing or no, an&#8217; so save his life, as it were, in spite o&#8217;
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Away with both!&rdquo; cried the knight, striking his
ironed heel upon the ground, and leaving the apartment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, if it is to be, it must be,&rdquo; said Simon, folding
his arms in resignation, &ldquo;an&#8217; there is no help for it! But,
oh, maister! maister! ye hae acted foolishly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were led from the prison-house, and through the
court-yard, towards a tall elm-tree, round which all the
retainers of Sir Gideon were assembled to witness the execution;
and the old knight took his place upon an elevated
seat in the midst of them.</p>

<p>The executioners were preparing to perform their office,
when Agnes, or Muckle-mouthed Meg, as she was called,
came forth, with a deep veil thrown over her face, and
sinking on her knee before the old knight, said,
imploringly&mdash;&ldquo;A boon, dear faither&mdash;yer dochter begs a simple boon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye tak an ill season to ask it, Meg,&rdquo; said the knight,
angrily; &ldquo;but what may it be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She whispered to him earnestly for a few minutes,
during which his countenance exhibited indignation and
surprise; and when she had finished speaking, she again
knelt before him and embraced his knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rise, Meg, rise!&rdquo; said he, impatiently, &ldquo;for yer sake,
an&#8217; at yer request, he shall hae another chance to live.&rdquo;
And, approaching the prisoner, he added&mdash;&ldquo;William
Scott, ye hae chosen death in preference to the hand o&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
my dochter. Will ye noo prefer to die rather than marry
the lassie that ran wi&#8217; the letter to yer mother, an&#8217; without
my consent brought her to see ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had another asked me the question,&rdquo; said the laird,
&ldquo;though I ken not who she is, yet she has a kind heart,
and I should hae said &lsquo;No,&rsquo; an&#8217; offered her my hand,
heart, an&#8217; fortune; but to you, Sir Gideon, I only say&mdash;do
yer worst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, Willie, my ain Willie!&rdquo; cried his mother, who
at that moment rushed forward, &ldquo;another does request ye
to marry her, an&#8217; that is yer ain mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&#8217;,&rdquo; said Agnes, stepping forward, and throwing
aside the veil that covered her face, &ldquo;puir Meg, ower
whom ye gied a preference to the gallows, also requests
ye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed the young laird, grasping her
hand, &ldquo;is the kind lassie that has striven, night and day,
to save me&mdash;the very Meg that I hae been treating wi&#8217;
disdain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In troth am I,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;an&#8217; do ye prefer the
wuddy still?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered he; and, turning to Sir Gideon, he
added&mdash;&ldquo;Sir, I am now willing that the ceremony end in matrimony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said the old knight, and the spectators
burst into a shout.</p>

<p>The day that began with preparations for death ended
in a joyful bridal. The honour of knighthood was afterwards
conferred upon the laird; and Meg bore unto him
many sons and daughters, and was, as the reader will be
ready to believe, one of the best wives in Scotland; while
Simon declared that he never saw a better-looking woman
in Ettrick Forest, his own wife and daughters not excepted.</p>

<h2>LORD DURIE AND CHRISTIE&#8217;S WILL.</h2>


<p>Who can journey, now-a-days, along the high parts of
Selkirkshire, and hear the mire-snipe whistle in the morass,
proclaiming itself, in the silence around, the unmolested
occupant of the waste, or descend into the green valley,
and see the lazy shepherd lying folded up in his plaid, while
his flocks graze in peace around him and in the distance,
and not think of the bold spirits that, in the times of Border
warfare, sounded the war-horn till it rang in reverberating
echoes from hill to hill? The land of the Armstrongs
knows no longer their kindred. The hills, ravines, mosses,
and muirs, that, only a few centuries ago, were animated
by the boldest spirits that ever sounded a war-cry, and
defended to the death by men whose swords were their
only charters of right, have passed into other hands, and
the names of the warlike holders serve now only to give a
grim charm to a Border ballad. An extraordinary lesson
may be read on the banks of the Liddel and the Esk&mdash;there
is a strange eloquence in the silence of these quiet dales.
Stand for a while among the graves of the chief of Gilnockie
and his fifty followers, in the lonely churchyard of
Carlenrig&mdash;cast a contemplative eye on the roofless tower
of that brave riever, then glance at the gorgeous policies
of Bowhill, and resist, if you can, the deep sigh that rises
as a tribute to the memories of men who, having, by their
sleepless spirits, kept a kingdom in commotion, died on the
gallows, and left no generation to claim their lands from
those who, with less bravery and no better sense of right,
had the subtle policy to rise on their ruins. Poorly, indeed,
now sound the names of Johnny Armstrong, Sim of
Whittram, Sim of the Cathill, Kinmont Willie, or Christie&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Will, besides those of Dukes of Buccleuch and Roxburgh,
Scott of Harden, and Elliot of Stobbs and Wells; and yet,
without wishing to take away the <em>merit</em> or the <em>extent</em> of
their ancestors&#8217; own &ldquo;reif and felonie,&rdquo; how much do they
owe to their succession to the ill-got gear of those hardy
Borderers whose names and scarcely credible achievements
are all that have escaped the rapacity that, not satisfied
with their lands, took also their lives! For smaller depredations,
the old laws of the Border&mdash;and it would not be
fair to exclude those of the present day, not confined to
that locality&mdash;awarded a halter; for thefts of a larger
kind, they gave a title. Old Wat of Buccleuch deserved
the honour of &ldquo;the neck garter&rdquo; just as much as poor
Johnny Armstrong; yet all he got was a reproof and a
dukedom.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Then up and spake the noble king&mdash;</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And an angry man, I trow, was he&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&lsquo;It ill becomes ye, bauld Bucclew,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">To talk o&#8217; reif or felonie;</span><br />
 For, if every man had his ain cow,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">A right puir clan yer name would be.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>There is a change now. The bones of the bold Armstrongs
lie in Carlenrig, and the descendants of their brother-rievers
who got their lands sit in high places, and speak
words of legislative command. But these things will be
as they have ever been. We cannot change the world,
far less remake it; but we can resuscitate a part of its
moral wonders; and, while the property of Christie&#8217;s Will,
the last of the bold Armstrongs, is now possessed by another
family, under a written title, we will do well to commit
to record a part of his fame.</p>

<p>It is well known that the chief of the family of Armstrongs
had his residence<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
at Mangerton in Liddesdale.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
There is scarcely now any trace of his tower, though time
has not exerted so cruel a hand against his brother Johnny
Armstrong&#8217;s residence, which lies in the Hollows near
Langholme. We know no tumult of the emotions of what
may be called antiquarian sentiment, so engrossing and
curious as that produced by the headless skeleton of &ldquo;auld
Gilnockie&#8217;s Tower,&rdquo; as it is seen in the grey gloaming, with
a breeze brattling through its dry ribs, and a stray owl
sitting on the top, and sending his eldritch screigh through
the deserted hollows. The mind becomes busy on the
instant with the former scenes of festivity, when &ldquo;their
stolen gear,&rdquo; &ldquo;baith nolt and sheep,&rdquo; and &ldquo;flesh, and
bread, and ale,&rdquo; as Maitland says, were eaten and drunk
with the <em>kitchen</em> of a Cheviot hunger, and the sweetness of
stolen things; and when the wild spirit of the daring outlaws,
with Johnny at their head, made the old tower of
the Armstrongs ring with their wassail shouts. This
Border turret came&mdash;after the execution of Johnny Armstrong,
and when the clan had become what was called a
broken clan&mdash;into the possession of William Armstrong,
who figured in the times of Charles I. He was called
Christie&#8217;s Will, though from what reason does not now
seem very clear; neither is it at all evident why, after the
execution of his forbear, Johnny, and his fifty followers,
at Carlenrig, the Tower of Gilnockie was not forfeited
to the crown, and taken from the rebellious clan altogether;
but, to be sure it was in those days more easy
to take a man&#8217;s life than his property, insomuch as the former
needed no guard, while the other would have required
a small standing army to keep it and the new proprietor
together. Certain, however, it is, that Christie&#8217;s Will did
get possession of the Tower of Gilnockie, where, according
to the practice of the family, he lived &ldquo;on Scottish ground
and English kye;&rdquo; and, when the latter could not easily
be had, on the poorer land of his neighbours of Scotland.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
This descendant of the Armstrongs was not unlike
Johnny; and, indeed, it has been observed that throughout
the whole branches of the family there was an extraordinary
union of boldness and humour&mdash;two qualities
which have more connection than may, at first view, be
apparent. Law-breakers, among themselves, are seldom
serious; a lightness of heart and a turn for wit being
necessary for the sustenance of their outlawed spirits, as
well as for a quaint justification&mdash;resorted to by all the
tribe&mdash;of their calling, against the laws of the land. In
the possession of these qualities, Will was not behind the
most illustrious of his race; but he, perhaps, excelled them
all in the art of &ldquo;<em>conveying</em>&rdquo;&mdash;a polite term then used for
that change of ownership which the affected laws of the
time denominated <em>theft</em>. This art was not confined to
cattle or plenishing, though</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;They left not spindell, spoone, nor speit,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bed, boster, blanket, sark, nor sheet:</span><br />
 John of the Park ryps kist and ark&mdash;<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">To all</span> sic wark he is sae meet.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>It extended to abduction, and this was far seldomer exercised
on damsels than on men, who would be well ransomed,
especially of those classes, duke, earl, or baron, any of
whom Johnny offered (for his life) to bring, &ldquo;within a
certain day, to his Majesty James V., either quick or
dead.&rdquo; This latter part of their art was the highest to
which the Borderers aspired; and there never was a riever
among them all that excelled in it so much as Christie&#8217;s
Will. &ldquo;To steal a stirk, or wear a score o&#8217; sheep <em>hamewards</em>,&rdquo;
he used to say, &ldquo;was naething; but to steal a <em>lord</em>
was the highest flicht o&#8217; a man&#8217;s genius, and ought never
to be lippened to a hand less than an Armstrong&#8217;s;&rdquo; and,
certainly, if the success with which he executed one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
scheme of that high kind will guarantee Will&#8217;s boasted
abilities, he did not transcend the truth in limiting
lord-stealing to the Armstrongs.</p>

<p>Will married a distant relation of the true Border breed,
named Margaret Elliot&mdash;a lass whose ideas of hussyskep
were so peculiar, that she thought Gilnockie and its laird
were going to ruin when she saw in the kail-pot a &ldquo;heugh
bane&rdquo; of their <em>own</em> cattle, a symptom of waste, extravagance,
and laziness, on the part of her husband, that boded
less good than the offer made by &ldquo;the Laird&#8217;s Jock,&rdquo;
(Johnny Armstrong&#8217;s henchman,) to give &ldquo;Dick o&#8217; the
Cow&rdquo; a piece of his own ox, which he came to ask reparation
for, and, not having got it, tied with St. Mary&#8217;s knot
(hamstringed) thirty good horses. To this good housewife,
in fact, might be traced, if antiquaries would renounce
for it less important investigations, the old saying,
that stolen joys (qu. queys?) are sweetest, undoubtedly a
Border aphorism, and now received into the society of
legitimate moral sayings. When lazy and not inclined
for &ldquo;felonie,&rdquo; Will would not subscribe to the truth of the
dictum, and often got for grace to the dinner he had not
taken from the English, and yet relished, the wish of the
good dame, that, for his want of spirit, it might choke him.
That effect, however, was more likely to be produced by
the beef got in the regular Border way; for the laws were
beginning now to be more vigorously executed, and many
a riever was astonished and offended by the proceedings
of the Justice-Ayr at Jedburgh, where they were actually
going the length of <em>hanging</em> for the crime of
<em>conveying</em> cattle from one property to another.</p>

<p>It was in vain that Will told his wife these proceedings
of the Jedburgh court; she knew very well that many of
the Armstrongs, and the famous Johnny among the rest,
had been strung up, by the command of their king, for
rebellion against his authority; but it was out of all question,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
beyond the reach of common sense, and, indeed,
utterly barbarous and unjust to hang a man, as Gilderoy&#8217;s
lover said, &ldquo;for gear,&rdquo; a thing that never yet was known
to be stationary, but, even from the times of the Old
Testament, given to taking to itself wings and flying away.
It was, besides, against the oldest constitution of things,
the old possessors being the <em>Tories</em>, who acted upon the
comely principle already alluded to, that right was might&mdash;the
new lairds, again, being the Whigs, who wished to take
from the Tories (the freebooters) the good old law of nature
and possession, and regulate property by the mere conceits
of men&#8217;s brains. To some such purpose did Margaret argue
against Will&#8217;s allusions to the doings at Jedburgh; but,
secretly, Will cared no more for the threat of a rope, than
he did for the empty bravado of a neighbour whom he had
eased of a score of cattle. He merely brought in the
doings of the Justice-Ayr at Jedburgh, to screen his fits
of laziness; those states of the mind common to rievers,
thieves, writers, and poets, and generally all people who
live upon their wits, which at times incapacitate them for
using sword or pen for their honest livelihood. But all
Margaret&#8217;s arguments and Will&#8217;s courage were on one occasion
overturned, by the riever&#8217;s apprehension for stealing a
cow, belonging to a farmer at Stobbs, of the name of Grant.
He was carried to Jedburgh jail, and indicted to stand his
trial before the Lord Justice-General at the next circuit.
There was a determination, on the part of the crown
authorities, to make an example of the most inveterate
riever of the time, and Will stood a very fair chance of
being hanged.</p>

<p>The apprehension of Will Armstrong made a great noise
throughout all Liddesdale, producing, to the class of victims,
joy, and to the class of spoilers, great dismay; but
none wondered more at the impertinence and presumption
of the government authorities in attempting thus to dislocate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the old Tory principle of &ldquo;might makes right,&rdquo; than
Margaret Elliot; who, as she sat in her turret of Gilnockie,
alternately wept and cursed for the fate of her &ldquo;winsome
Will,&rdquo; and, no doubt, there was in the projected condemnation
and execution of a man six feet five inches high,
with a face like an Adonis, shoulders like a Milo, the speed
of Mercury, the boldness of a lion, and more than the
generosity of that noble animal, for the crime of stealing
a stirk, something that was very apt to rouse, even in those
who loved him not so well as did Margaret, feelings of
sympathy for his fate, and indignation against his oppressors.
There was no keeping, as the artists say, in the
picture, no proper causality in a stolen cow, for the production
of such an effect as a hanged Phaon or strangled
Hercules; and though we have used some classic names
to grace our idea, the very same thought, at least as good
a one, though perhaps not so gaudily clothed, occupied the
mind of Margaret Elliot. She sobbed and cried bitterly,
till the Gilnockie ravens and owls, kindred spirits, were
terrified from the riever&#8217;s tower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this o&#8217;t?&rdquo; she exclaimed, in the midst of her
tears. &ldquo;Shall Christie&#8217;s Will, the bravest man o&#8217; the
Borders, be hanged because a cow, that kenned nae better,
followed him frae Stobbs to the Hollows; and shall it be
said that Margaret Elliot was the death o&#8217; her braw riever?
I had meat enough in Gilnockie larder that day I scorned
him wi&#8217; his laziness, and forced him to do the deed that
has brought him to Jedburgh jail. But I&#8217;ll awa to the
warden, James Stewart o&#8217; Traquair, and see if it be the
king&#8217;s high will that a man&#8217;s life should be ta&#8217;en for a
cow&#8217;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Making good her resolution, Margaret threw her plaid
about her shoulders, and hied her away to Traquair House,
the same that still stands on the margin of the Tweed, and
raises its high white walls, perforated by numerous Flemish-shaped
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
windows, among the dark woods of Traquair.
When she came to the front of the house, and saw the two
stone figures stationed at the old gate, she paused and
wondered at the weakness and effeminacy of the Lord
High Steward in endeavouring to defend his castle by
fearful representations of animals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My faith,&rdquo; muttered she to herself, as she approached
to request entrance, &ldquo;the warden was right in no makin&#8217;
choice o&#8217; the figure o&#8217; a <em>quey</em> to defend his castle.&rdquo; And
she could scarcely resist a chuckle in the midst of her
tears, at her reference to the cause of her visit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is my Lord Steward at hame?&rdquo; said she to the servant
who answered her call.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the man; &ldquo;who is it that wishes to see him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mistress o&#8217; Gilnockie,&rdquo; rejoined Margaret, &ldquo;has
come to seek a guid word for Christie&#8217;s Will, who now lies
in Jedburgh jail for stealing a tether, and I fear may hang
for&#8217;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servant heard this extraordinary message as servants
who presume to judge of the sense of their messages ever
do, with critical attention, and, after serious consideration,
declared that he could not deliver such a message to his
lord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dinna want ye to deliver my message, man,&rdquo; said
Margaret. &ldquo;I merely wished to be polite to ye, and show
ye a little attention. God be thankit, the mistress o&#8217; Gilnockie
can deliver her ain errand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, pushing the waiting man aside by a sudden jerk
of her brawnie arm, she proceeded calmly forward to a
door, which she intended to open; but the servant was at
her heels, and, laying hold of her plaid, was in the act of
hauling her back, when the Warden himself came out, and
asked the cause of the affray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the house yours, my Lord, or this man&#8217;s?&rdquo; said
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Margaret. &ldquo;Take my advice, my Lord,&rdquo; (whispering in
his ear,) &ldquo;turn him aff&mdash;he&#8217;s a traitor; would you believe
it, my Lord, that, though placed there for the purpose o&#8217;
lettin&#8217; folk into yer Lordship, he actually&mdash;ay, as sure as
death&mdash;tried to keep me oot! Can ye deny it, sir? Look
i&#8217; my face, and deny it if ye daur!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man smiled, and his Lordship laughed; and Margaret
wondered at the easy good-nature of a Lord in forgiving
such a heinous offence on the part of a servitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If ye&#8217;re as kind to me as ye are to that rebel,&rdquo; continued
Margaret, as she followed his Lordship into his sitting
chamber, &ldquo;Christie&#8217;s Will winna hang yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What mean you, good woman?&rdquo; said the Warden.
&ldquo;What is it that you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if your Lordship didna ken,&rdquo; answered Margaret,
with a knowing look. &ldquo;Is it likely that a Liddesdale
woman frae the Hollows, should ca&#8217; upon the great Warden
for aught short o&#8217; the life and safety o&#8217; the man wha&#8217;s in
Jedburgh jail?&rdquo; (Another Scotch wink.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am still at a loss, good woman,&rdquo; said the Warden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At a loss!&rdquo; rejoined Margaret. &ldquo;What! doesna a&#8217; the
Forest,<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>
and Teviotdale and Tweeddale to boot, ken that
Christie&#8217;s Will is in Jedburgh jail?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, I know, good dame,&rdquo; replied the Warden,
&ldquo;that that brave riever is in prison; but I thought his
crime was the stealing of a cow, and not a tether, as I heard
you say to my servant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, weel&mdash;the cow may have been at the end o&#8217; the
tether,&rdquo; replied Margaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is a wise woman who concealeth the <em>extremity</em> of
her husband&#8217;s crime,&rdquo; replied Lord Traquair, with a smile,
&ldquo;But what wouldst thou have me to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just to save Christie&#8217;s Will frae the gallows, my Lord,&rdquo;
answered Margaret. And, going up close to his Lordship,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and whispering in his ear&mdash;&ldquo;And sometimes a Lord needs
a lift as weel as ither folk. If there&#8217;s nae buck on Traquair
when your Lordship has company at the castle, you hae
only to gie Christie&#8217;s Will a nod, and there will be nae
want o&#8217; venison here for a month. There&#8217;s no a stouthriever
in a&#8217; Liddesdale, be he baron or bondsman, knight or
knave, but Christie&#8217;s Will will bring to you at your Lordship&#8217;s
bidding, and a week&#8217;s biding; and if there&#8217;s ony
want o&#8217; a braw leddie,&rdquo; (speaking low,) &ldquo;to keep the bonny
house o&#8217; Traquair in order, an&#8217; she canna be got for a
carlin keeper, a wink to Christie&#8217;s Will will bring her here,
unscathed by sun or wind, in suner time than a priest
could tie the knot, or a lawyer loose it. Is sic a man a
meet burden for a fir wuddy, my Lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By my faith, your husband hath good properties about
him,&rdquo; replied Traquair. &ldquo;There is not one in these parts
that knoweth not Christie&#8217;s Will; but I fear it is to that
fame he oweth his danger. He is the last of the old
Armstrongs; and there is a saying hereaway, that</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&lsquo;Comes Liddesdale&#8217;s peace</span><br />
 When Armstrongs cease;&rsquo;</p>

<p>and since, good dame, it would ill become the King&#8217;s
Warden to let slip the noose that is to catch peace and
order for our march territories, yet Will is too noble a
fellow for hanging. Go thy ways. I&#8217;ll see him&mdash;I&#8217;ll see
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hech na, my Lord,&rdquo; answered Margaret; &ldquo;I&#8217;ll no
budge frae this house till ye say ye&#8217;ll save him this ance.
I&#8217;ll be caution and surety for him mysel&#8217;, that he&#8217;ll never
again dine in Gilnockie on another man&#8217;s surloins. His
clan has been lang a broken ane; but I am now the head
o&#8217;t, and it has aye been the practice in our country to
make the head answer for the rest o&#8217; the body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that is the practice of the hangman at Jedburgh,&rdquo;
replied Traquair, laughing. &ldquo;But go thy ways. Will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
shall not hang yet. He hath a job to do for me. There&#8217;s
a &lsquo;lurdon&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>
of the north he must steal for me. I&#8217;ll take
thy bond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gie me your hand then, my Lord,&rdquo; said the determined
dame; &ldquo;and the richest lurdon o&#8217; the land he&#8217;ll
bring to your Lordship, as surely as he ever took a Cumberland
cow&mdash;whilk, as your Lordship kens, is nae rieving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Traquair gave the good dame his hand, and she departed,
wondering, as she went, what the Lord Warden was to do
with a stolen lurdon. A young damsel might have been a
fair prize for the handsome baron; but an &ldquo;auld wife,&rdquo; as
she muttered to herself, was the most extraordinary object
of rieving she had ever heard of, amidst all the varieties
of a Borderer&#8217;s prey. Next day Traquair mounted his
horse, and&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Traquair has riden up Chaplehope,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">An&#8217; sae has he doun by the Grey-Mare&#8217;s-Tail;</span><br />
 He never stinted the light gallop,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until he speered for Christie&#8217;s Will.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Having arrived at Jedburgh, he repaired direct to the
jail, where Margaret had been before him, to inform her
husband that the great Lord Warden was to visit him,
and get him released; but upon the condition of stealing
away a lurdon in the north&mdash;a performance, the singularity
of which was much greater than the apparent difficulty,
unless, indeed, as Will said, she was a bedridden lurdon,
in which case, it would be no easy matter to get her conveyed,
as horses were the only carriers of stolen goods in
those days. But the wonder why Traquair should wish to
steal away an old woman had perplexed the wits of Will
and his wife to such an extent, that they had recourse to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the most extraordinary hypotheses; supposing at one time
that she was some coy heiress of seventy summers, who
had determined to be carried off after the form of young
damsels in the times of chivalry; at another, that she was
the parent of some lord, who could only be brought to
concede something to the Warden by the force of the
impledgment of his mother; and, again, that she was the
duenna of an heiress, who could only be got through the
confinement of the old hag. Be who she might, however,
Christie&#8217;s Will declared, upon the faith of the long shablas
of Johnny Armstrong, that he would carry her off through
fire and water, as sure as ever Kinmont Willie was carried
away by old Wat of Buccleuch from the Castle of Carlisle.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Oh, was it war-wolf in the wood,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or was it mermaid in the sea,</span><br />
 Or was it maid or lurdon auld,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">He&#8217;d carry an&#8217; bring her bodilie.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Such was the heroic determination to which Christie&#8217;s
Will had come, when the jailor came and whispered in his
ear, that the Lord Warden was in the passage on the way
to see him. Starting to his feet, the riever was prepared
to meet the baron, of whom he generally stood in so much
awe in his old tower of Gilnockie, but who came to him
now on a visit of peace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou&#8217;lt hang, Will, this time,&rdquo; said the Warden, with
an affectation of gruffness, as he stepped forward.
&ldquo;It is not in the power of man to save ye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Begging yer Lordship&#8217;s pardon,&rdquo; replied Will, &ldquo;I believe
it, however, to be in the power o&#8217; a woman. The
auld lurdon will be in Gilnockie tower at yer Lordship&#8217;s
ain time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who is the &lsquo;auld lurdon?&rsquo;&rdquo; replied the Warden,
trying to repress a laugh, which forced its way in spite of
his efforts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Margaret couldna tell me that,&rdquo; said Will; &ldquo;but many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
a speculation we had on the question yer Lordship has now
put to me. &lsquo;Wha can she be?&rsquo; said Peggy; and &lsquo;Wha can
she be?&rsquo; replied I; but it&#8217;s for yer Lordship to say wha
she <em>is</em>, and for me to steal the auld limmer awa, as sure as
ever I <em>conveyed</em> an auld milker frae the land o&#8217; the Nevills.
I&#8217;m nae sooner free than she&#8217;s a prisoner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The familiarity with which Will spoke of the female
personage thus destined to durance vile, produced another
laugh on the part of the Warden, not altogether consistent,
as Will thought, with the serious nature of the subject in
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is she, my Lord?&rdquo; continued Will; &ldquo;in what
fortress?&mdash;wha is her keeper?&mdash;whar will I tak her, and
how long retain her a prisoner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear, Will, she is beyond the power o&#8217; mortal,&rdquo; said
his Lordship, in a serious voice; &ldquo;but on condition of thy
making a fair trial, I will make intercession for thy life,
and take the chance of thy success. Much hangeth by the
enterprise&mdash;ay, even all my barony of Coberston dependeth
upon that &lsquo;lurdon&rsquo; being retained three months in
a quiet corner of Gr&aelig;me&#8217;s Tower. Thou knowest the
place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, weel, weel,&rdquo; replied Will, who began to see the
great importance of the enterprise, while his curiosity to
know who the object was had considerably increased.
&ldquo;That tower has its &lsquo;redcap sly.&rsquo; E&#8217;en Lord Soulis&#8217;
Hermitage is no better guarded. Ance there, and awa
wi&#8217; care, as we say o&#8217; Gilnockie as a rendezvous for <em>strayed</em>
steers. But who is she, my Lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou hast thyself said she is a woman,&rdquo; replied the
Warden, smiling, &ldquo;and I correct thee not. Hast thou ever
heard, Will, of fifteen old women&mdash;&lsquo;lurdons,&rsquo; as the good
people call them&mdash;that reside in a large house in the Parliament
close of Edinburgh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brawly, brawly,&rdquo; answered Will, with a particular
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
leer of fun and intelligence; &ldquo;and weel may I ken the
limmers&mdash;real lurdons, wi&#8217; lang gowns and curches. Ken
them! Wha that has a character to lose, or a property
to keep against the claims o&#8217; auld parchment, doesna ken
thae fifteen auld runts? They keep the hail country side
in a steer wi&#8217; their scandal. Nae man&#8217;s character is safe
in their keeping; and they&#8217;re sae fu&#8217; o&#8217; mischief that they
hae even blawn into the king&#8217;s lug that my tower o&#8217;
Gilnockie was escheat to the king by the death o&#8217; my
ancestor, who was hanged at Carlenrig. They say a&#8217; the
mischief that has come on the Borders sin&#8217; the guid auld
times, has its beginning in that coterie o&#8217; weazened gimmers.
Dootless, they&#8217;re at the root o&#8217; the danger o&#8217; yer bonny
barony o&#8217; Coberston. By the rood! I wish I had a dash
at their big curches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, Will,&rdquo; responded Traquair; &ldquo;but they&#8217;re securely
lodged in their strong Parliament House, and the difficulty
is how to get at them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I fancy ane o&#8217; the lurdons will satisfy yer Lordship,&rdquo;
said Will, &ldquo;or do ye want them a&#8217; lodged in Gr&aelig;me&#8217;s
Tower? They would mak a bonny nest o&#8217; screighing
hoolets, if we had them safely under the care o&#8217; the sly
redcap o&#8217; that auld keep: they wad hatch something else
than scandal, and leasin-makin, and reports o&#8217; the instability
o&#8217; Border rights, the auld jauds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be content with one of them,&rdquo; rejoined the
Warden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! I see, I see,&rdquo; replied Will. &ldquo;Ane o&#8217; the
limmers has been sapping and undermining Coberston
wi&#8217; her hellish scandal. What&#8217;s the lurdon&#8217;s name, my
Lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gibson of Durie,&rdquo; rejoined Traquair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! a weel-kenned scandalous runt that,&rdquo; replied
Will. &ldquo;She&#8217;s the auldest o&#8217; the hail fifteen, if I&#8217;m no
cheated&mdash;Leddie President o&#8217; the coterie. She spak sair
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
against me when the King&#8217;s advocate claimed for his
Majesty my auld turret o&#8217; Gilnockie. I owe that quean
an auld score. How lang do you want her lodged in
Gr&aelig;me&#8217;s Tower?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three months would maybe change her tongue,&rdquo;
replied the Warden; &ldquo;but the enterprise seems desperate, Will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Desperate! my Lord,&rdquo; replied the other&mdash;&ldquo;that word&#8217;s
no kenned on the Borders. Is it the doing o&#8217;t, or the
dool for the doing o&#8217;t, that has the desperation in&#8217;t?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The consequences to you would be great, Will,&rdquo; said
Traquair. &ldquo;You are confined here for stealing a cow,
and would be hanged for it if I did not save ye. Our
laws are equal and humane. For stealing a cow one may
be hanged; but there&#8217;s no such law against stealing a
paper-lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That shows the guid sense o&#8217; our lawgivers,&rdquo; replied
Will, with a leer on his face. &ldquo;The legislator has wisely
weighed the merits o&#8217; the twa craturs; yet, were it no for
your case, my Lord, I could wish the law reversed. I wad
be in nae hurry stealing ane o&#8217; thae cummers, at least for
my ain use; and, as for Peggy, she would rather see a cow
at Gilnockie ony day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, Will,&rdquo; said his Lordship, &ldquo;I do not ask thee to
steal for me old Leddie Gibson. I dare not. You understand
me; but I am to save your life; and I tell thee
that, if that big-wigged personage be not, within ten days,
safely lodged in Gr&aelig;me&#8217;s Tower, my lands of Coberston
will find a new proprietor, and your benefactor will be
made a lordly beggar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fear not, my Lord,&rdquo; replied Will. &ldquo;I&#8217;m nae suner
out than she&#8217;s in. She&#8217;ll no say a word against Coberston
for the next three months, I warrant ye. But, by my
faith, it&#8217;s as teuch a job as boilin&#8217; auld Soulis in the cauldron
at the Skelfhill; and I hae nae black spae-book like
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Thomas to help my spell. Yet, after a&#8217;, my Lord, what
spell is like the wit o&#8217; man, when he has courage to act up
to &#8217;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Warden acknowledged the truth of Will&#8217;s heroic
sentiment; and, having satisfied himself that the bold
riever would perform his promise, he departed, and in two
days afterwards the prisoner was liberated, and on his way to
his residence at the Hollows. It was apparent, from Will&#8217;s
part of the dialogue, that he had some knowledge of the
object the Lord Warden had in view in carrying off a
Lord of Session from the middle of the capital; yet it is
doubtful if he troubled himself with more than the fact of
its being the wish of his benefactor that the learned judge
should be for a time confined in Gr&aelig;me&#8217;s Tower; and,
conforming to a private hint of his Lordship before he departed
from the jail, he kept up in his wife Margaret&#8217;s
mind the delusion that it was truly &ldquo;an auld lurdon&rdquo;
whom he was to steal, as a condition for getting out of
prison. On the morning after his arrival at Gilnockie,
Will held a consultation with two tried friends, whose assistance
he required in this most extraordinary of all the rieving
expeditions he had ever yet been engaged in; and the
result of their long sederunt was, that, within two hours after,
the three were mounted on as many prancing Galloways,
and with a fourth led by a bridle, and carrying their provisions,
a large cloak, and some other articles. They took
the least frequented road to the metropolis of Scotland.
Having arrived there, they put up their horses at a small
hostelry in the Grassmarket; and, next day, Will, leaving
his friends at the inn, repaired to that seat of the law and
learning of Scotland, where the &ldquo;hail fifteen&rdquo; sat in grim
array, munching, with their toothless jaws, the thousand
scraps of Latin law-maxims (borrowed from the Roman and
feudal systems) which then ruled the principles of judicial
proceedings in Scotland.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Planting himself in one of the litigants&#8217; benches&mdash;a line
of seats in front of the semicircle where the fifteen Lords
sat&mdash;the Liddesdale riever took a careful survey of all the
wonders of that old laboratory of law. The first objects
that attracted his attention, were, of course, the imposing
semicircular line of judges, no fewer than fifteen (almost
sufficient for a small standing army for puny Scotland in
those days), who, wigged and robed, sat and nodded and
grinned, and munched their chops in each other&#8217;s faces,
with a most extraordinary regularity of mummery, which
yielded great amusement to the stalworth riever of the
Borders. Their appearance in the long gowns, with
sleeves down to the hands, wigs whose lappets fell on their
breasts, displaying many a line of crucified curl, and white
cambric cravats falling from below their gaucy double-chins
on their bosoms, suggested at once the appellation
of lurdons, often applied to them in those days, and now
vivid in the fancy of the staring Borderer, whose wild and
lawless life was so strangely contrasted with that of the
drowsy, effeminate-looking individuals who sat before him.
He understood very little of their movements, which had
all the regularity and ceremony of a raree-show. One
individual (the macer) cried out, at intervals, with a
cracked voice, some words he could not understand; but
the moment the sound had rung through the raftered
hall, another species of wigged and robed individuals
(advocates) came forward, and spoke a strange mixture of
English and Latin, which Will could not follow; and,
when they had finished, the whole fifteen looked at each
other, and then began, one after another, but often two or
three at a time, to speak, and nod, and shake their wigs,
as if they had been set agoing by some winding-up process
on the part of the advocates. Not one word of all
this did Will understand; and, indeed, he cared nothing
for such mummery, but ever and anon fixed his keen eye
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
on the face of the middle senator, with an expression that
certainly never could have conveyed the intelligence that
that rough country-looking individual meditated such a
thing as an abduction of the huge incorporation of law
that sat there in so much state and solidity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! my old lass,&rdquo; said Will to himself; &ldquo;ye little
ken that the Laird o&#8217; Gilnockie, whom ye tried to deprive
of his birthright, sits afore ye; and will a&#8217; the lear &#8217;neath
that big wig tell ye that that same Laird o&#8217; Gilnockie sits
here contriving a plan to run awa wi&#8217; ye? Faith, an&#8217; it&#8217;s a
bauld project; but the baulder the bonnier, as we say in
Liddesdale. I only wish I could tak her wig and gown
wi&#8217; her&mdash;for, if the lurdon were seen looking out o&#8217; Gr&aelig;me&#8217;s
Tower, wi&#8217; that lang lappet head-gear, there would be nae
need o&#8217; watch or ward to keep her there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will had scarcely finished his monologue, when he heard
the macer cry out, &ldquo;Maxwell against Lord Traquair;&rdquo; then
came forward the advocates, and shook their wigs over the
bar, and at length old Durie, the President, said, in words
that did not escape Will&#8217;s vigilant ear&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This case, I believe, involves the right to the large
barony of Coberston. Seven of my brethren, you are
aware, have given their opinions in favour of the defendant,
Lord Traquair, and seven have declared for the
pursuer, Maxwell. My casting vote must, therefore, decide
the case, and I have been very anxious to bring my
mind to a conclusion on the subject, with as little delay as
possible; but there are difficulties which I have not yet
been able to surmount.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, and there&#8217;s a new ane here, sittin&#8217; afore ye,&rdquo;
muttered Will, &ldquo;maybe the warst o&#8217; them a&#8217;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I still require some new lights,&rdquo; continued the judge.
&ldquo;I have already, as the case proceeded, partially announced
an opinion against Lord Traquair; but I wish confirmation
before I pronounce a judgment that is to have the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
effect of turning one out of possession of a large barony.
I am sorry that my learned friends at the bar have not
been able to relieve me of my scruples.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stupid fules,&rdquo; muttered Will; &ldquo;but I&#8217;ll relieve ye, my
Lord Durie. It&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er be said that a Lord o&#8217; Session
stood in need o&#8217; relief, and a Border riever in the court,
wha has a hundred times made the doubtin&#8217; stirk tak ae
road (maybe Gilnockie-ways) in preference to anither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Traquair case being the last called that day, the
court broke up, and the judges, followed still by the eye of
Christie&#8217;s Will, retired into the robing-room to take off
their wigs and gowns. The Borderer now inquired, in a
very simple manner, at a macer, at what door the judges
came out of the court, as he was a countryman, and was
curious to see their Lordships dressed in their usual every-day
clothes. The request was complied with; and Will,
as a stupid gazing man from the Highlands, who wished
to get an inane curiosity gratified by what had nothing
curious in it, was placed in a convenient place to see the
Solomons pass forth on their way to their respective dwellings.
They soon came; and Will&#8217;s lynx eye caught, in
a moment, the face of the President, whom, to his great
satisfaction, he now found to be a thin, spare, portable
individual, and very far from the unwieldy personage
which his judge&#8217;s dress made him appear to be when
sitting on the bench&mdash;a reversing of the riever&#8217;s thoughts,
in reference to the spareness and fatness of his object of
seizure, that brought a twinkle to his eye in spite of the
serious task in which he was engaged. Forth went the
President with great dignity, and Christie&#8217;s Will behind
him, dogging him with the keen scent of a sleuth-hound.
To his house in the Canongate he slowly bent his steps,
ruminating as he went, in all likelihood, upon the difficulties
of the Traquair case, from which his followers were so
anxious to relieve him. Will saw him ascend the steps
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
and enter, and his next object was to ascertain at what
time he took his walk, and to what quarter of the suburbs
he generally resorted; but on this point he could not get
much satisfaction, the good judge being in his motions
somewhat irregular, though (as Will learned) seldom a
day passed without his having recourse to the country in
some direction or other. Will, therefore, set a watch
upon the house. Another of his friends held the horses
at the foot of Leith Wynd, while he himself paced between
the watchman and the top of the passage, so that he might
have both ends of the line always in his eye. A concerted
whistle was to regulate their movements.</p>

<p>The first day passed without a single glimpse being had
of the grave senator, who was probably occupied in the
consultation of legal authorities, little conscious of the care
that was taken about his precious person by so important
an individual as the far-famed Christie&#8217;s Will of Gilnockie.
On the second day, about three of the afternoon, and two
hours after he had left the Parliament House, a whistle
from Will&#8217;s friend indicated that the grave judge was on
the steps of his stair. Will recognised him in an instant,
and, despatching his friend to him who held the horses at
the foot of the Wynd, with instructions to keep behind
him at a distance, he began to follow his victim slowly,
and soon saw with delight that he was wending his senatorial
steps down towards Leith. The unconscious judge
seemed drowned in study: his eyes were fixed on the
ground; his hands placed behind his back; and, ever and
anon, he twirled a gold-headed cane that hung suspended
by a silken string from one of his fingers. Will was certain
that he was meditating the fall of Coberston, and
the ruin of his benefactor, Traquair; and, as the thought
rose in his mind, the fire of his eye burned brighter, and
his resolution mounted higher and higher, till he could
even have seized his prey in Leith lane, and carried him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
off amidst the cries of the populace. But his opportunity
was coming quicker than he supposed. To enable him to
get deeper and deeper into his brown study, Durie was
clearly bent upon avoiding the common road where passengers
put to flight his ideas; and, turning to the right,
went up a narrow lane, and continued to saunter on till
he came to that place commonly known by the name of
the Figgate Whins. In that sequestered place, where
scarcely an individual was seen to pass in an hour, the
deep thinking of the cogitative senator might trench the
soil of the law of prescription, turn up the principle which
regulated tailzies under the second part of the act 1617,
and bury Traquair&#8217;s right to Coberston. No sound but
the flutter of a bird, or the moan of the breaking waves
of the Frith of Forth, could there interfere with his train
of thought. Away he sauntered, ever turning his gold-headed
cane, and driving his head farther and farther into
the deep hole where, like the ancient philosopher, he expected
to find truth. Sometimes he struck his foot against
a stone, and started and looked up, as if awakened from a
dream; but he was too intent on his study to take the
pains to make a complete turn of his wise head, to see if
there was any one behind him. During all this time, a
regular course of signals was in progress among Will and
his friends who were coming up behind him, the horses
being kept far back, in case the sound of their hoofs might
reach the ear of the day-dreamer. He had now reached
the most retired and lonely part of the common, where,
at that time, there stood a small clump of trees at a little
distance from the whin-road that gave the place its singular
name. His study still continued, for his head was still
bent, and he looked neither to the right nor to the left.
In a single instant, he was muffled up in a large cloak, a
hood thrown over his face, and his hands firmly bound by
a cord. The operation was that of a moment&mdash;finished
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
before the prisoner&#8217;s astonishment had left him power to
open his mouth. A whistle brought up the horses; he
was placed on one of them with the same rapidity; a cord
was passed round his loins and bound to the saddle; and,
in a few minutes, the party was in rapid motion to get to
the back part of the city.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>During all this extraordinary operation, not a single
word passed between the three rievers, to whom the
proceeding was, in a great degree, perfectly familiar.
Through the folds of the hood of the cloak in which the
President&#8217;s head was much more snugly lodged than it
ever was in his senatorial wig, he contrived to send forth
some muffled sounds, indicating, not unnaturally, a wish
to know what was the meaning and object of so extraordinary
a man&oelig;uvre. At that time, be it understood, the
belief in the power of witches was general, and Durie
himself had been accessary to the condemnation of many
a wise woman who was committed to the flames; but
though he had, to a great extent, emancipated his strong
mind from the thraldom of the prevailing prejudice, the
mode in which he was now seized&mdash;in broad day, in the
midst of a legal study, without seeing a single individual
(his head being covered first), and without hearing the
sound of man&#8217;s voice&mdash;would have been sufficient to bring
him back to the general belief, and force the conviction
that he was now in the hands of the agents of the Devil.
It is, indeed, a fact (afterwards ascertained), that the
learned judge did actually conceive that he was now in
the power of those he had helped to persecute; and his
fears&mdash;bringing up before him the burning tar-barrels,
the paid prickers, the roaring crowds, and the expiring
victim&mdash;completed the delusion, and bound up his energies,
till he was speechless and motionless. There was,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
therefore, no cause of apprehension from the terror-struck
prisoner himself; and, as the party scoured along, they
told every inquiring passenger on the way (for they were
obliged, in some places, to ask the road) that they were
carrying an auld lurdon to Dumfries, to be burnt for
exercising the power of her art on the innocent inhabitants
of that district. It was, therefore, no uncommon thing for
Durie to hear himself saluted by all the appellations generally
applied to the poor persecuted class to which he was
supposed to belong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, awa wi&#8217; the auld limmer,&rdquo; cried one, &ldquo;and see
that the barrels are fresh frae Norraway, and weel-lined
wi&#8217; the bleezing tar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be sure and prick her weel,&rdquo; cried another; &ldquo;the
foul witch may be fireproof. If she winna burn, boil her
like Meg Davy at Smithfield, or Shirra Melville on the
hill o&#8217; Garvock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These cries coming on the ear of the astonished judge,
did not altogether agree with his preconceived notions of
being committed to the power of the Evil One; but they
tended still farther to confuse him, and he even fancied at
times that the vengeance of the populace, which thus rung
in his ears, was in the act of being realized, and that he
was actually to suffer the punishment he had so often
awarded to others. Some expressions wrung from him by
his fear, and overheard by the quick ear of Will, gave the
latter a clue to the workings of his mind, and he did not
fail to see how he might take advantage of it. As night
began to fall, they had got far on their way towards
Moffat, and, consequently, far out of danger of a pursuit
and a rescue. Durie&#8217;s horse was pricked forward at a
speed not inconsistent with his power of keeping the
saddle. They stopped at no baiting place, but kept pushing
forward, while the silence was still maintained, or, if
it ever was broken, it was to introduce, by interlocutory
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
snatches of conversation, some reference to the doom which
awaited the unhappy judge. The darkness in which he
was muffled, the speed of his journey, the sounds and
menaces that had met his ear, all co-operating with the
original sensations produced by his mysterious seizure,
continued to keep alive the terrors he at first felt, to over-turn
all the ordinary ideas and feelings of the living world,
and to sink him deeper and deeper in the confusion that
had overtaken his mind in the midst of his legal reverie
at the Figgate Whins.</p>

<p>The cavalcade kept its course all next day, and, towards
the evening, they approached Gr&aelig;me&#8217;s Tower, a dark,
melancholy-looking erection, situated on Dryfe Water, not
very distant from the village of Moffat. In a deep cell of
this old castle the President of the Court of Session was
safely lodged, with no more light than was supplied by a
small grating, and with a small supply of meat, only sufficient
to allay at first the pangs of hunger. Will having
thus executed his commission, sat down and wrote on a
scrap of paper these expressive words&mdash;&ldquo;The brock&#8217;s in
the pock!&rdquo; and sent it with one of his friends to Traquair
House. The moment the Earl read the scrawl, he knew
that Will had performed his promise, and took a hearty
laugh at the extraordinary scheme he had resorted to for
gaining his plea. It was not yet, however, his time to
commence his proceedings; but, in a short while after the
imprisonment of the President, he set off for Edinburgh,
which town he found in a state of wonder and ferment
at the mysterious disappearance of the illustrious Durie.
Every individual he met had something to say on the
subject; but the prevailing opinion was, that the unhappy
President had ventured upon that part of the sands near
Leith where the incoming tide usually encloses, with great
rapidity, large sand-banks, and often overwhelms helpless
strangers who are unacquainted with the manner in which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the tide there flows. Numbers of people had exerted
themselves in searching all the surrounding parts, and
some had traversed the whole coast from Musselburgh to
Cramond, in the expectation of finding the body upon the
sea-shore. But all was in vain: no President was found;
and a month of vain search and expectation having passed,
the original opinion settled down into a conviction that he
had been drowned. His wife, Lady Durie, after the first
emotions of intense grief, went, with her whole family,
into mourning; and young and old lamented the fate of
one of the most learned judges and best men that ever
sat on the judgment-seat of Scotland.</p>

<p>There was nothing now to prevent Traquair from reaping
the fruits of his enterprise. He pressed hard for a
judgment in his case; and pled that the fourteen judges
having been equally divided, he was entitled to a decision
in his favour as <em>defender</em>. This plea was not at that time
sustained; but a new president having been appointed,
who was favourable to his side of the question, the case
was again to be brought before the court, and the Earl
expected to carry his point, and reap all the benefit of
Will&#8217;s courage and ingenuity.</p>

<p>Meantime, the dead-alive President was closely confined
in the old tower of Gr&aelig;me, and had never recovered from
the feelings of superstition which held the sovereign power
of his mind at the time of his confinement. He never saw
the face of man, his food being handed into him by an
unseen hand, through a small hole at the foot of the door.
The small grating was not situated so as to yield him any
prospect; and the only sounds that greeted his ears were
the calls of the shepherds who tended their sheep in the
neighbouring moor. Sometimes he heard men&#8217;s voices
calling out &ldquo;Batty!&rdquo; and anon a female crying &ldquo;Maudge!&rdquo;
The former was the name of a shepherd&#8217;s dog, and the
latter was the name of the cat belonging to an old woman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
who occupied a small cottage adjoining to the tower.
Both the names sounded strangely and ominously in the
ears of the President, and sorely did he tax his wits as to
what they implied. Every day he heard them, and every
time he heard them he meditated more and more as to the
species of beings they denominated. Still remaining in
the belief that he was in the hands of evil powers, he imagined
that these strange names, Batty and Maudge, were
the earthly titles of the two demons that held the important
authority of watching and tormenting the President of
the Court of Session. He had heard these often, and
suffered so much from their cruel tyranny, that he became
nervous when the ominous sounds struck on his ear, and
often (as he himself subsequently admitted) he adjured
heaven, in his prayers, to take away Maudge and Batty,
and torment him no longer by their infernal agency.
&ldquo;Relieve me, relieve me, from these conjunct and confident
spirits, cruel Maudge and inexorable Batty,&rdquo; (he
prayed,) &ldquo;and any other punishment due to my crimes I
will willingly bear.&rdquo; Exorcisms in abundance he applied
to them, and used many fanciful tricks of demon-expelling
agency to free him from their tyranny; but all to no purpose.
The names still struck his ear in the silence of his
cell, and kept alive the superstitious terror with which he
was enslaved.</p>

<p>Traquair, meanwhile, pushed hard for a decision, and,
at last, after a period of about three months, the famous
cause was brought before the court, and the successor of
the dead-alive President having given his vote for the defender,
the wily Warden carried his point, and secured to
him and his heirs, in time coming, the fine barony in dispute,
which, for aught we know to the contrary, is in the
family to this day.</p>

<p>It now remained for the actors in this strange drama to
let free the unhappy Durie, and relieve him from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
power of his enemies. The Warden accordingly despatched
a messenger to Christie&#8217;s Will, with the laconic and emphatic
demand&mdash;&ldquo;Let the brock out o&#8217; the pock&rdquo;&mdash;a return
of Will&#8217;s own humorous message, which he well understood.
Will and his associates accordingly went about the important
deliverance in a manner worthy of the dexterity
by which the imprisonment had been effected. Having
opened the door of his cell, they muffled him up in the
same black cloak in which he was enveloped at the Figgate
Whins, and leading him to the door, placed him on the
back of a swift steed, while they mounted others, with
a view to accompany him. Setting off at a swift pace,
they made a circuit of the tower in which he had been
confined, and continuing the same circuitous route round
and round the castle for a period of two or three hours,
they stopped at the very door of his cell from which they
had started. They then set him down upon the ground,
and again mounting their horses, took to their heels, and
never halted till they arrived at Gilnockie.</p>

<p>On being left alone, Durie proceeded to undo the cords
by which the cloak was fastened about his head; and, for
the first time after three months, breathed the fresh air
and saw the light of heaven. He had ridden, according to
his own calculation, about twenty miles; and, looking
round him, he saw alongside of him the tower of Gr&aelig;me,
an old castle he had seen many years before, and recollected
as being famous in antiquarian reminiscence. The
place he had been confined in must have been some castle
twenty miles distant from Gr&aelig;me&#8217;s Tower&mdash;a circumstance
that would lead him, he thought, to discover the place of
his confinement, though he was free to confess that he was
utterly ignorant of the direction in which he had travelled.
Thankful for his deliverance, he fell on his knees, and
poured out a long prayer of gratitude for being thus
freed from his enemies, Batty and Maudge. The distance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
he had travelled must have taken him far away from the
regions of their influence&mdash;the most grateful of all the
thoughts that now rose in his wondering mind. No more
would these hated names strike his ear with terror and
dismay, and no more would he feel the tyranny of their
demoniac sway. As these thoughts were passing through
his mind a sound struck his ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Batty, lad!&mdash;far yaud, far yaud!&rdquo; cried a voice
by his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God have mercy on me! here again,&rdquo; ejaculated the
president.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maudge, ye jaud!&rdquo; cried another voice, from the door
of a poor woman&#8217;s cottage.</p>

<p>The terrified president lifted his eyes, and saw a goodly
shepherd, with a long staff in his hand, crying to his dog,
Batty, to drive his sheep to a distance; and, a little
beyond, a poor woman sat at her door, looking for her
black cat, that sat on the roof of the cottage, and would
not come down for all the energies of her squeaking
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What could all this mean?&rdquo; now ejaculated Durie.
&ldquo;Have I not been for three months tortured with these
sounds, which I attributed to evil spirits? I have ridden
from them twenty miles, and here they are again, in the
form of fair honest denominations of living animals. I am
in greater perplexity than ever. While I thought them
evil spirits, I feared them as such; but now, God help me,
they have taken on the forms of a dog and cat, and this
shepherd and this old woman are kindred devils, under
whose command they are. What shall I do, whither run
to avoid them, since twenty miles have been to them as a
flight in the air?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s a braw morning, sir,&rdquo; said the shepherd. &ldquo;How
far hae ye come this past night?&mdash;for I ken nae habitation
near whar ye may hae rested.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
&ldquo;It&#8217;s seldom we see strangers hereawa,&rdquo; said the old
woman, &ldquo;at this early hour&mdash;will ye come in, sir, and
rest ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Durie looked first at the one and then at the other,
bewildered and speechless. The fair face of nature before
him, with the forms of God&#8217;s creatures, and the sounds of
human voices in his ears, were as nothing to recollections
and sensations which he could not shake from his mind.
He had, for certain, heard these dreadful sounds for three
months; he had ridden twenty miles, and now he heard
them again, mixed up with the delusive accompaniments
of the enticing speeches of a man and a woman. He would
fly, but felt himself unable; and, standing under the influence
of the charm of his own terrors, he continued to look,
first at the shepherd and then at the old woman, in wonder
and dismay. The people knew as little what to think of
him as he did in regard to them. He looked wild and
haggard, his eyes rolled about in his head, his voice was
mute; and the cloak, which he had partially unloosed
from his head, hung in strange guise down his back, and
flapped in the wind. The old castle had its &ldquo;red cap,&rdquo; a
fact known to both the shepherd and the old woman, who
had latterly heard strange sounds coming from it. Might
not Durie be the spirit in another form? The question
was reasonable, and was well answered by the wildly-staring
president, who was still under the spell of his
terrors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Avaunt ye!&mdash;avaunt! in the name o&#8217; the haly rude o&#8217;
St. Andrews!&rdquo; cried the woman, now roused to a state of
terror.</p>

<p>The same words were repeated by the simple-minded
shepherd, and poor Durie&#8217;s fears were, if possible, increased;
for it seemed that they were now performing
some new incantation, whereby he would be again reduced
to their power; but he was now in the open air, and why
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
not take advantage of the opportunity of escaping from
their thraldom? The moment the idea started in his
mind, he threw from him the accursed cloak, and flew
away over the moor as fast as his decayed limbs, inspired
by terror, would carry him. As he ran, he heard the old
woman clapping her hands, and crying &ldquo;Shoo, shoo!&rdquo; as
if she had been exorcising a winged demon. After running
till he was fairly out of the sights and sounds that
had produced in him so much terror, he sat down, and
took a retrospect of what had occurred to him during the
preceding three months; but he could come to no conclusion
that could reconcile all the strange things he had
experienced with any supposition based on natural powers.
It was certain, however, that he was still upon the earth,
and it was probable he was now beyond the power of his
evil genius. His best plan, therefore, under all the
circumstances, was to seek home, and Lady Durie and his
loving family, who would doubtless be in a terrible condition
on account of his long absence; and even this idea,
pleasant as it was, was qualified by the fear that he might,
for aught he knew, have been away, like the laird of
Comrie, for many, perhaps a hundred years, and neither
Lady Durie, nor friend or acquaintance, would be alive to
greet him on his return. Of all this, however, he must
now take his chance; and, rising and journeying forward,
he came to a house, where he asked for some refreshment
by way of charity; for he had nothing in the world to pay
for what he required. He was fortunate in getting some
relief from the kind woman to whom he had applied, and
proceeded to speak to her on various topics with great
sense and propriety, as became the ex-President of the
Court of Session; but when, to satisfy his scruples, he
asked her the day of the month, then the month of the
year, and then the year of the Lord, the good woman was
satisfied he was mad; and, with a look of pity, recommended
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
him to proceed on his way, and get home as fast
as he could.</p>

<p>So on the president went, begging his way from hamlet
to hamlet, getting alms from one and news from another,
but never gratified with the year of the Lord in which he
lived; for, when he put that question, he was uniformly
pitied, and allowed to proceed on his way for a madman.
He heard, however, several times that President Durie had
been drowned in the Frith of Forth, and that a new President
of the Court of Session had been appointed in his
place. Whether his wife was married again or not, he
could not learn, and was obliged to wrestle with this and
other fears as he still continued his way to the metropolis.
At last Edinburgh came in view, and glad was he to see
again the cat&#8217;s head of old St. Arthur&#8217;s, and the diadem of
St. Giles rearing their heights in the distance. Nearer
and nearer he approached the place of his home, happiness,
and dignity; but, as he came nearer still, he began
to feel all the effects of his supposed demise. Several of
his old acquaintances stared wildly at him as they passed,
and, though he beckoned to them to stand and speak, they
hurried on, and seemed either not to recognise him, or to
be terrified at him. At last he met Lord F&mdash;&mdash;, the
judge who had sat for many years next to him on the
bench; and, running up to him, he held out his hand in
kindly salutation, grinning, with his long thin jaws and
pallid cheeks, a greeting which he scarcely understood
himself. By this time it was about the gloaming, and
such was the extraordinary effect produced by his sudden
appearance and changed cadaverous look, that his old
brother of the bench got alarmed, and fairly took to his
heels, as if he had seen a spectre. Undaunted, however,
he pushed on, and by the time he reached the Canongate
it was almost dark. He went direct to his own house, and
peeping through the window, saw Lady Durie sitting by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the fire dressed in weeds, and several of his children
around, arrayed in the same style. The sight brought the
tears of joy to his eyes, and, forgetting entirely the effect
his appearance would produce, he threw open the door,
and rushed into the room. A loud scream from the
throats of the lady and the children rang through the
whole house, and brought up the servants, who screamed
in their turn, and some of them fainted, while others
ran away; and no one had any idea that the emaciated
haggard being before them was other than the grim ghost
of Lord President Durie, come from the other world to
terrify the good people of this. The confusion, however,
soon ceased; for Durie began to speak softly to them, and,
taking his dear lady in his arms, pressed her to his bosom in
a way that satisfied her that he was no ghost, but her own
lord, who, by some mischance, had been spirited away by
some bad angels. The children gradually recovered their
confidence, and in a short time joy took the place of fear,
and all the neighbourhood was filled with the news that
Lord Durie had come alive again, and was in the living
body in his own house. Shortly after the good lord sat
down by the fire and got his supper, and, by the quantity
he ate, satisfied his lady and family still more that he
carried a good body, with as fair a capability of reception
as he ever exhibited after a walk at the Figgate Whins.
He told them all he had undergone since first he was
carried away, not forgetting the two spirits, Batty and
Maudge, that had tormented him so cruelly during the
period of his enchantment. The lady and family stared
with open mouths as they heard the dreadful recital; but
a goodly potation of warm spiced wine drove off the
vapours produced by the dismal story, and, by-and-by,
Lord Durie and his wife retired to bed&mdash;the one weary
and exhausted with his trials, and the other with her
terrors and her joys.</p>

<h2>RECOLLECTIONS OF BURNS.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></h2>

<p class="center"><strong>CHAPTER I.</strong></p>

<div class="box">
<p style="margin-left: 12em;">&ldquo;Wear we not graven on our hearts<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">The name of Robert Burns!&rdquo;&mdash;<em>American Poet.</em></span></p>
</div>

<p>The degrees shorten as we proceed from the higher to the
lower latitudes&mdash;the years seem to shorten in a much
greater ratio as we pass onward through life. We are
almost disposed to question whether the brief period of
storms and foul weather that floats over us with such
dream-like rapidity, and the transient season of flowers
and sunshine that seems almost too short for enjoyment,
be at all identical with the long summers and still longer
winters of our boyhood, when day after day and week after
week stretched away in dim perspective, till lost in the
obscurity of an almost inconceivable distance. Young as
I was, I had already passed the period of life when we
wonder how it is that the years should be described as
short and fleeting; and it seemed as if I had stood but
yesterday beside the death-bed of the unfortunate Ferguson,
though the flowers of four summers and the snows of four
winters had now been shed over his grave.</p>

<p>My prospects in life had begun to brighten. I served
in the capacity of mate in a large West India trader, the
master of which, an elderly man of considerable wealth,
was on the eve of quitting the sea; and the owners had
already determined that I should succeed him in the
charge. But fate had ordered it otherwise. Our seas
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
were infested at this period by American privateers&mdash;prime
sailors, and strongly armed; and, when homeward
bound from Jamaica with a valuable cargo, we were
attacked and captured when within a day&#8217;s sailing of Ireland,
by one of the most formidable of the class. Vain as
resistance might have been deemed&mdash;for the force of the
American was altogether overpowering&mdash;and though our
master, poor old man! and three of the crew, had fallen
by the first broadside, we had yet stood stiffly by our
guns, and were only overmastered when, after falling foul
of the enemy, we were boarded by a party of thrice our
strength and number. The Americans, irritated by our
resistance, proved on this occasion no generous enemies;
we were stripped and heavily ironed, and, two days after,
were set ashore on the wild coast of Connaught, without a
single change of dress, or a sixpence to bear us by the way.</p>

<p>I was sitting, on the following night, beside the turf fire
of a hospitable Irish peasant, when a seafaring man, whom
I had sailed with about two years before, entered the
cabin. The meeting was equally unexpected on either
side. My acquaintance was the master of a smuggling
lugger then on the coast; and on acquainting him with
the details of my disaster, and the state of destitution to
which it had reduced me, he kindly proposed that I should
accompany him on his voyage to the west coast of Scotland,
for which he was then on the eve of sailing. &ldquo;You
will run some little risk,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as the companion of a
man who has now been thrice outlawed for firing on his
Majesty&#8217;s flag; but I know your proud heart will prefer
the danger of bad company at its worst, to the alternative
of begging your way home.&rdquo; He judged rightly. Before
daybreak we had lost sight of land, and in four days more
we could discern the precipitous shores of Carrick stretching
in a dark line along the horizon, and the hills of the
interior rising thin and blue behind, like a volume of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
clouds. A considerable part of our cargo, which consisted
mostly of tea and spirits, was consigned to an Ayr trader,
who had several agents in the remote parish of Kirkoswald,
which at this period afforded more facilities for carrying
on the contraband trade than any other on the western
coast of Scotland; and, in a rocky bay of the parish, we
proposed unlading on the following night. It was necessary,
however, that the several agents, who were yet ignorant
of our arrival, should be prepared to meet with us;
and, on volunteering my service for the purpose, I was
landed near the ruins of the ancient castle of Turnberry,
once the seat of Robert the Bruce.</p>

<p>I had accomplished my object; it was evening, and a
party of countrymen were sauntering among the cliffs,
waiting for nightfall and the appearance of the lugger.
There are splendid caverns on the coast of Kirkoswald;
and, to while away the time, I had descended to the shore
by a broken and precipitous path, with a view of exploring
what are termed the Caves of Colzean, by far the finest
in this part of Scotland. The evening was of great beauty;
the sea spread out from the cliffs to the far horizon, like
the sea of gold and crystal described by the prophet; and
its warm orange hues so harmonized with those of the sky,
that, passing over the dimly-defined line of demarcation,
the whole upper and nether expanse seemed but one glorious
firmament, with the dark Ailsa, like a thunder-cloud,
sleeping in the midst. The sun was hastening to his setting,
and threw his strong red light on the wall of rock
which, loftier and more imposing than the walls of even
the mighty Babylon, stretched onward along the beach,
headland after headland, till the last sank abruptly in the
far distance, and only the wide ocean stretched beyond. I
passed along the insulated piles of cliff that rise thick along
the basis of the precipices&mdash;now in sunshine, now in
shadow&mdash;till I reached the opening of one of the largest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
caves. The roof rose more than fifty feet over my head&mdash;a
broad stream of light, that seemed redder and more
fiery from the surrounding gloom, slanted inwards, and, as
I paused in the opening, my shadow, lengthened and dark,
fell athwart the floor&mdash;a slim and narrow bar of black&mdash;till
lost in the gloom of the inner recess. There was a
wild and uncommon beauty in the scene that powerfully
affected the imagination; and I stood admiring it in that
delicious dreamy mood in which one can forget all but the
present enjoyment, when I was roused to a recollection of
the business of the evening by the sound of a footfall echoing
from within. It seemed approaching by a sort of cross
passage in the rock, and, in a moment after, a young man,
one of the country people whom I had left among the cliffs
above, stood before me. He wore a broad Lowland bonnet,
and his plain homely suit of coarse russet seemed to
bespeak him a peasant of perhaps the poorest class; but,
as he emerged from the gloom, and the red light fell full
on his countenance, I saw an indescribable something in
the expression that in an instant awakened my curiosity.
He was rather above the middle size, of a frame the most
muscular and compact I have almost ever seen, and there
was a blended mixture of elasticity and firmness in his
tread, that to one accustomed, as I had been, to estimate
the physical capabilities of men, gave evidence of a union
of immense personal strength with great activity. My first
idea regarding the stranger&mdash;and I know not how it should
have struck me&mdash;was that of a very powerful frame, animated
by a double portion of vitality. The red light
shone full on his face, and gave a ruddy tinge to the
complexion, which I afterwards found it wanted&mdash;for he was
naturally of a darker hue than common; but there was
no mistaking the expression of the large flashing eyes, the
features that seemed so thoroughly cast in the mould of
thought, and of the broad, full, perpendicular forehead.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Such, at least, was the impression on my mind, that I
addressed him with more of the courtesy which my earlier
pursuits had rendered familiar to me, than of the bluntness
of my adopted profession. &ldquo;This sweet evening,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;is by far too fine for our lugger; I question whether, in
these calms, we need expect her before midnight; but, &#8217;tis
well, since wait we must, that &#8217;tis in a place where the
hours may pass so agreeably.&rdquo; The stranger, good-humouredly,
acquiesced in the remark, and we sat down
together on the dry, water-worn pebbles, mixed with
fragments of broken shells and minute pieces of wreck,
that strewed the opening of the cave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was there ever a lovelier evening!&rdquo; he exclaimed;
&ldquo;the waters above the firmament seem all of a piece with
the waters below. And never surely was there a scene of
wilder beauty. Only look inwards, and see how the
stream of red light seems bounded by the extreme darkness,
like a river by its banks, and how the reflection
of the ripple goes waving in golden curls along the
roof!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been admiring the scene for the last half
hour,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;Shakspeare speaks of a music that cannot
be heard, and I have not yet seen a place where one might
better learn to comment on the passage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both the thought and the phrase seemed new to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A music that cannot be heard!&rdquo; he repeated; and
then, after a momentary pause, &ldquo;you allude to the fact,&rdquo;
he continued, &ldquo;that sweet music, and forms such as these,
of silent beauty and grandeur, awaken in the mind emotions
of nearly the same class. There is something truly
exquisite in the concert of to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I muttered a simple assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;how finely these insulated piles
of rock, that rise in so many combinations of form along
the beach, break and diversify the red light, and how the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
glossy leaves of the ivy glisten in the hollows of the
precipices above! And then, how the sea spreads away to
the far horizon, a glorious pavement of crimson and gold!&mdash;and
how the dark Ailsa rises in the midst, like the little
cloud seen by the prophet! The mind seems to enlarge,
the heart to expand, in the contemplation of so much of
beauty and grandeur. The soul asserts its due supremacy.
And, oh! &#8217;tis surely well that we can escape from
those little cares of life which fetter down our thoughts,
our hopes, our wishes, to the wants and the enjoyments of
our animal existence; and that, amid the grand and the
sublime of nature, we may learn from the spirit within us
that we are better than the beasts that perish!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked up to the animated countenance and flashing
eyes of my companion, and wondered what sort of a
peasant it was I had met with. &ldquo;Wild and beautiful as
the scene is,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you will find, even among those
who arrogate to themselves the praise of wisdom and
learning, men who regard such scenes as mere errors of
nature. Burnet would have told you that a Dutch landscape,
without hill, rock, or valley, must be the perfection
of beauty, seeing that Paradise itself could have furnished
nothing better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hold Milton as higher authority on the subject,&rdquo;
said my companion, &ldquo;than all the philosophers who ever
wrote. Beauty, in a tame unvaried flat, where a man
would know his country only by the milestones! A very
Dutch Paradise, truly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But would not some of your companions above,&rdquo; I
asked, &ldquo;deem the scene as much an error of nature as
Burnet himself? They could pass over these stubborn
rocks neither plough nor harrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;there is a species of small wisdom
in the world that often constitutes the extremest of its
folly; a wisdom that would change the entire nature of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
<em>good</em>, had it but the power, by vainly endeavouring to
render that good universal. It would convert the entire
earth into one vast corn field, and then find that it had
ruined the species by its improvement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We of Scotland can hardly be ruined in that way for
an age to come,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But I am not sure that I
understand you. Alter the very nature of good in the
attempt to render it universal! How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay you have seen a graduated scale,&rdquo; said my
companion, &ldquo;exhibiting the various powers of the different
musical instruments, and observed how some of limited
scope cross only a few of the divisions, and how others
stretch nearly from side to side. &#8217;Tis but a poor truism,
perhaps, to say that similar differences in scope and power
obtain among men&mdash;that there are minds who could not
join in the concert of to-night&mdash;who could see neither
beauty nor grandeur amid these wild cliffs and caverns, or
in that glorious expanse of sea and sky; and that, on the
other hand, there are minds so finely modulated&mdash;minds
that sweep so broadly across the scale of nature, that there
is no object, however minute, no breath of feeling, however
faint, but that it awakens their sweet vibrations&mdash;the
snow-flake falling in the stream, the daisy of the field, the
conies of the rock, the hysop of the wall. Now, the vast
and various frame of nature is adapted not to the lesser,
but to the larger mind. It spreads on and around us in
all its rich and magnificent variety, and finds the full
portraiture of its Proteus-like beauty in the mirror of genius
alone. Evident, however, as this may seem, we find a sort
of levelling principle in the inferior order of minds, and
which, in fact, constitutes one of their grand characteristics&mdash;a
principle that would fain abridge the scale to
their own narrow capabilities&mdash;that would cut down the
vastness of nature to suit the littleness of their own conceptions
and desires, and convert it into one tame, uniform,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
<em>m&eacute;diocre good</em>, which would be <em>good</em> but to
themselves alone, and ultimately not even that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can now understand you,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;you
describe a sort of swinish wisdom that would convert the
world into one vast sty. For my own part, I have travelled
far enough to know the value of a blue hill, and would
not willingly lose so much as one of these landmarks of our
mother land, by which kindly hearts in distant countries
love to remember it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay we are getting fanciful,&rdquo; rejoined my companion;
&ldquo;but certainly, in man&#8217;s schemes of improvement,
both physical and moral, there is commonly a littleness
and want of adaptation to the general good that
almost always defeats his aims. He sees and understands
but a minute portion&mdash;it is always some partial good he
would introduce; and thus he but destroys the just proportions
of a nicely-regulated system of things by exaggerating
one of the parts. I passed of late through a richly-cultivated
district of country, in which the agricultural
improver had done his utmost. Never were there finer
fields, more convenient steadings, crops of richer promise,
a better regulated system of production. Corn and cattle
had mightily improved; but what had man, the lord of
the soil, become? Is not the body better than food, and
life than raiment? If that decline for which all other
things exist, it surely matters little that all these other
things prosper. And here, though the corn, the cattle, the
fields, the steadings had improved, man had sunk. There
were but two classes in the district: a few cold-hearted
speculators, who united what is worst in the character of
the landed proprietor and the merchant&mdash;these were your
gentleman farmers; and a class of degraded helots, little
superior to the cattle they tended&mdash;these were your farm
servants. And for two such extreme classes&mdash;necessary
result of such a state of things&mdash;had this unfortunate,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
though highly-eulogized district, parted with a moral,
intelligent, high-minded peasantry&mdash;the true boast and
true riches of their country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have, I think, observed something like what you
describe,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but one instance of a thousand.
But mark how the sun&#8217;s lower disk has just reached the
line of the horizon, and how the long level rule of light
stretches to the very innermost recess of the cave! It
darkens as the orb sinks. And see how the gauze-like
shadows creep on from the sea, film after film!&mdash;and now
they have reached the ivy that mantles round the castle of
The Bruce. Are you acquainted with Barbour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;a spirited, fine old fellow, who loved
his country and did much for it. I could once repeat all
his chosen passages. Do you remember how he describes
King Robert&#8217;s rencounter with the English knight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My companion sat up erect, and, clenching his fist, began
repeating the passage, with a power and animation
that seemed to double its inherent energy and force.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glorious old Barbour!&rdquo; ejaculated he, when he had
finished the description; &ldquo;many a heart has beat all the
higher when the bale-fires were blazing, through the
tutorage of thy noble verses! Blind Harry, too&mdash;what
has not his country owed to him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, they have long since been banished from our
popular literature,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;and yet Blind Harry&#8217;s &lsquo;Wallace,&rsquo;
as Hailes tells us, was at one time the very Bible of
the Scotch. But love of country seems to be getting
old-fashioned among us, and we have become philosophic
enough to set up for citizens of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All cold pretence,&rdquo; rejoined my companion; &ldquo;an
effect of that small wisdom we have just been decrying.
Cosmopolitism, as we are accustomed to define it, can be
no virtue of the present age, nor yet of the next, nor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
perhaps for centuries to come. Even when it shall have
attained to its best, and when it may be most safely
indulged in, it is according to the nature of man, that,
instead of running counter to the love of country, it should
exist as but a wider diffusion of the feeling, and form, as
it were, a wider circle round it. It is absurdity itself to
oppose the love of our country to that of our race.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I rightly understand you?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You look
forward to a time when the patriot may safely expand into
the citizen of the world; but, in the present age, he would
do well, you think, to confine his energies within the
inner circle of country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Decidedly,&rdquo; he rejoined; &ldquo;man should love his species
at all times, but it is ill with him if, in times like the
present, he loves not his country more. The spirit of war
and aggression is yet abroad&mdash;there are laws to be established,
rights to be defended, invaders to be repulsed,
tyrants to be deposed. And who but the patriot is equal
to these things? We are not yet done with the Bruces,
the Wallaces, the Tells, the Washingtons&mdash;yes, the Washingtons,
whether they fight for or against us&mdash;we are not
yet done with them. The cosmopolite is but a puny
abortion&mdash;a birth ere the natural time, that at once
endangers the life and betrays the weakness of the country
that bears him. Would that he were sleeping in his
elements till his proper time! But we are getting ashamed
of our country, of our language, our manners, our music,
our literature; nor shall we have enough of the old spirit
left us to assert our liberties or fight our battles. Oh, for
some Barbour or Blind Harry of the present day, to make
us, once more, proud of our country!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I quoted the famous saying of Fletcher of Salton&mdash;&ldquo;Allow
me to make the songs of a country, and I will
allow you to make its laws.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But here,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is our lugger stealing round Turnberry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Head. We shall soon part, perhaps for ever, and I
would fain know with whom I have spent an hour so
agreeably, and have some name to remember him by.
My own name is Matthew Lindsay; I am a native of
Irvine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said the young man, rising and cordially
grasping the proffered hand, &ldquo;am a native of Ayr; my
name is Robert Burns.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">If friendless, low, we meet together,<br />
Then, sir, your hand&mdash;my friend and brother!<br />

<p>A light breeze had risen as the sun sunk, and our lugger,
with all her sails set, came sweeping along the shore.
She had nearly gained the little bay in front of the cave,
and the countrymen from above, to the number of perhaps
twenty, had descended to the beach, when, all of a sudden,
after a shrill whistle, and a brief half minute of commotion
among the crew, she wore round and stood out to sea.
I turned to the south, and saw a square-rigged vessel
shooting out from behind one of the rocky headlands, and
then bearing down in a long tack on the smuggler. &ldquo;The
sharks are upon us,&rdquo; said one of the countrymen, whose
eyes had turned in the same direction&mdash;&ldquo;we shall have no
sport to-night.&rdquo; We stood lining the beach in anxious
curiosity; the breeze freshened as the evening fell; and
the lugger, as she lessened to our sight, went leaning
against the foam in a long bright furrow, that, catching
the last light of evening, shone like the milky way amid
the blue. Occasionally we could see the flash, and hear
the booming of a gun from the other vessel; but the night
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
fell thick and dark; the waves too began to lash against
the rocks, drowning every feebler sound in a continuous
roaring; and every trace of both the chase and the chaser
disappeared. The party broke up, and I was left standing
alone on the beach, a little nearer home, but in every other
respect in quite the same circumstances as when landed by
my American friends on the wild coast of Connaught.
&ldquo;Another of Fortune&#8217;s freaks!&rdquo; I ejaculated; &ldquo;but &#8217;tis
well she can no longer surprise me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A man stepped out in the darkness as I spoke, from
beside one of the rocks; it was the peasant Burns, my
acquaintance of the earlier part of the evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have waited, Mr. Lindsay,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to see whether
some of the country folks here, who have homes of their
own to invite you to, might not have brought you along
with them. But I am afraid you must just be content to
pass the night with me. I can give you a share of my bed
and my supper, though both, I am aware, need many
apologies.&rdquo; I made a suitable acknowledgment, and we
ascended the cliff together. &ldquo;I live, when at home with
my parents,&rdquo; said my companion, &ldquo;in the inland parish of
Tarbolton; but, for the last two months, I have attended
school here, and lodge with an old widow woman in the
village. To-morrow, as harvest is fast approaching, I return
to my father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;shall have the pleasure of accompanying
you in at least the early part of your journey, on
my way to Irvine, where my mother still lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We reached the village, and entered a little cottage, that
presented its gable to the street, and its side to one of the
narrower lanes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must introduce you to my landlady,&rdquo; said my companion,
&ldquo;an excellent, kind-hearted old woman, with a
fund of honest Scotch pride and shrewd good sense in her
composition, and with the mother as strong in her heart as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
ever, though she lost the last of her children more than
twenty years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We found the good woman sitting beside a small but
very cheerful fire. The hearth was newly swept, and the
floor newly sanded; and, directly fronting her, there was
an empty chair, which seemed to have been drawn to its
place in the expectation of some one to fill it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are going to leave me, Robert, my bairn,&rdquo; said
the woman, &ldquo;an&#8217; I kenna how I sall ever get on without
you; I have almost forgotten, sin you came to live with
me, that I have neither children nor husband.&rdquo; On seeing
me, she stopped short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An acquaintance,&rdquo; said my companion, &ldquo;whom I have
made bold to bring with me for the night; but you must
not put yourself to any trouble, mother; he is, I daresay,
as much accustomed to plain fare as myself. Only, however,
we must get an additional pint of <em>yill</em> from the <em>clachan;</em>
you know this is my last evening with you, and was to be
a merry one at any rate.&rdquo; The woman looked me full in
the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matthew Lindsay!&rdquo; she exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;can you have
forgotten your poor old aunt Margaret!&rdquo; I grasped her
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dearest aunt, this is surely most unexpected! How
could I have so much as dreamed you were within a hundred
miles of me?&rdquo; Mutual congratulation ensued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she said, turning to my companion, &ldquo;is the
nephew I have so often told you about, and so often wished
to bring you acquainted with. He is, like yourself, a great
reader and a great thinker, and there is no need that your
proud, kindly heart should be jealous of him; for he has
been ever quite as poor, and maybe the poorer of the two.&rdquo;
After still more of greeting and congratulation, the young
man rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The night is dark, mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the road to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the clachan a rough one; besides you and your kinsman
will have much to say to one another. I shall just slip
out to the clachan for you; and you shall both tell me
on my return whether I am not a prime judge of ale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The kindest heart, Matthew, that ever lived,&rdquo; said my
relative, as he left the house; &ldquo;ever since he came to
Kirkoswald, he has been both son and daughter to me,
and I shall feel twice a widow when he goes away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am mistaken, aunt,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if he be not the
strongest minded man I ever saw. Be assured he stands
high among the aristocracy of nature, whatever may be
thought of him in Kirkoswald. There is a robustness of
intellect, joined to an overmastering force of character,
about him, which I have never yet seen equalled, though
I have been intimate with at least one very superior mind,
and with hundreds of the class who pass for men of talent.
I have been thinking ever since I met with him, of the
William Tells and William Wallaces of history&mdash;men who,
in those times of trouble which unfix the foundations of
society, step out from their obscurity to rule the destiny
of nations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was ill about a month ago,&rdquo; said my relative&mdash;&ldquo;so
very ill that I thought I was to have done with the world
altogether; and Robert was both nurse and physician to
me&mdash;he kindled my fire, too, every morning, and sat up
beside me sometimes for the greater part of the night.
What wonder I should love him as my own child? Had
your cousin Henry been spared to me, he would now have
been much about Robert&#8217;s age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conversation passed to other matters, and in about
half an hour, my new friend entered the room; when we
sat down to a homely, but cheerful repast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been engaged in argument, for the last twenty
minutes, with our parish schoolmaster,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;a
shrewd, sensible man, and a prime scholar, but one of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
most determined Calvinists I ever knew. Now, there is
something, Mr. Lindsay, in abstract Calvinism, that dissatisfies
and distresses me; and yet, I must confess, there
is so much of good in the working of the system, that I
would ill like to see it supplanted by any other. I am
convinced, for instance, there is nothing so efficient in
teaching the bulk of a people to think as a Calvinistic
church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Robert,&rdquo; said my aunt, &ldquo;it does meikle mair nor
that. Look round ye, my bairn, an&#8217; see if there be a kirk
in which puir sinful creatures have mair comfort in their
sufferings or mair hope in their deaths.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear mother,&rdquo; said my companion, &ldquo;I like well enough
to dispute with the schoolmaster, but I must have no dispute
with you. I know the heart is everything in these
matters, and yours is much wiser than mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something in abstract Calvinism,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;that distresses me. In almost all our researches
we arrive at an ultimate barrier, which interposes its wall
of darkness between us and the last grand truth, in the
series which we had trusted was to prove a master-key to
the whole. We dwell in a sort of Goshen&mdash;there is light
in our immediate neighbourhood, and a more than Egyptian
darkness all around; and as every Hebrew must have
known that the hedge of cloud which he saw resting on
the landscape, was a boundary not to things themselves,
but merely to his view of things&mdash;for beyond there were
cities, and plains, and oceans, and continents&mdash;so we in
like manner must know that the barriers of which I speak
exist only in relation to the faculties which we employ,
not to the objects on which we employ them. And yet,
notwithstanding this consciousness that we are necessarily
and irremediably the bound prisoners of ignorance, and
that all the great truths lie outside our prison, we can
almost be content that, in most cases, it should be so&mdash;not,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
however, with regard to those great unattainable
truths which lie in the track of Calvinism. They seem too
important to be wanted, and yet want them we must&mdash;and
we beat our very heads against the cruel barrier
which separates us from them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I hardly understand you,&rdquo; I said;&mdash;&ldquo;do
assist me by some instance of illustration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are acquainted,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;with the Scripture
doctrine of Predestination, and, in thinking over it, in
connection with the destinies of man, it must have struck
you that, however much it may interfere with our fixed
notions of the goodness of Deity, it is thoroughly in
accordance with the actual condition of our race. As far
as we can know of ourselves and the things around us,
there seems, through the will of Deity&mdash;for to what else
can we refer it?&mdash;a fixed, invariable connection between
what we term cause and effect. Nor do we demand of
any class of mere effects, in the inanimate or irrational
world, that they should regulate themselves otherwise
than the causes which produce them have determined.
The roe and the tiger pursue, unquestioned, the instincts
of their several natures; the cork rises, and the stone
sinks; and no one thinks of calling either to account for
movements so opposite. But it is not so with the family
of man; and yet our minds, our bodies, our circumstances,
are but combinations of effects, over the causes of which
we have no control. We did not choose a country for
ourselves, nor yet a condition in life&mdash;nor did we determine
our modicum of intellect, or our amount of passion&mdash;we
did not impart its gravity to the weightier part of our
nature, or give expansion to the lighter&mdash;nor are our
instincts of our own planting. How, then, being thus as
much the creatures of necessity as the denizens of the wild
and forest&mdash;as thoroughly under the agency of fixed, unalterable
causes, as the dead matter around us&mdash;why are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
we yet the subjects of a retributive system, and accountable
for all our actions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You quarrel with Calvinism,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;and seem one
of the most thorough-going necessitarians I ever knew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;though my judgment cannot
disprove these conclusions, my heart cannot acquiesce in
them&mdash;though I see that I am as certainly the subject of
laws that exist and operate independent of my will, as the
dead matter around me, I feel, with a certainty quite as
great, that I am a free, accountable creature. It is
according to the scope of my entire reason that I should
deem myself bound&mdash;it is according to the constitution of
my whole nature that I should feel myself free. And in
this consists the great, the fearful problem&mdash;a problem
which both reason and revelation propound; but the
truths which can alone solve it, seem to lie beyond the
horizon of darkness&mdash;and we vex ourselves in vain. &#8217;Tis
a sort of moral asymptotes; but its lines, instead of approaching
through all space without meeting, seem receding
through all space, and yet meet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robert, my bairn,&rdquo; said my aunt, &ldquo;I fear you are
wasting your strength on these mysteries to your ain hurt.
Did ye no see, in the last storm, when ye staid out among
the caves till cock-crow, that the bigger and stronger the
wave, the mair was it broken against the rocks?&mdash;it&#8217;s just
thus wi&#8217; the pride o&#8217; man&#8217;s understanding, when he measures
it against the dark things o&#8217; God. An&#8217; yet it&#8217;s sae
ordered, that the same wonderful truths which perplex and
cast down the proud reason, should delight and comfort
the humble heart. I am a lone, puir woman, Robert.
Bairns an&#8217; husband have gone down to the grave, one by
one; an&#8217; now, for twenty weary years, I have been childless
an&#8217; a widow. But trow ye that the puir lone woman
wanted a guard, an&#8217; a comforter, an&#8217; a provider, through
a&#8217; the lang mirk nichts, an&#8217; a&#8217; the cauld scarce winters o&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
these twenty years? No, my bairn&mdash;I kent that Himsel&#8217;
was wi&#8217; me. I kent it by the provision He made, an&#8217; the
care He took, an&#8217; the joy He gave. An&#8217; how, think you,
did He comfort me maist? Just by the blessed assurance
that a&#8217; my trials an&#8217; a&#8217; my sorrows were nae hasty chance
matters, but dispensations for my guid, an&#8217; the guid o&#8217;
those He took to Himsel&#8217;, that, in the perfect love and
wisdom o&#8217; His nature, He had ordained frae the beginning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, mother,&rdquo; said my friend, after a pause, &ldquo;you
understand the doctrine far better than I do! There
are, I find, no contradictions in the Calvinism of the
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<div class="box">
<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Ayr, gurgling, kissed his pebbled shore,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">O&#8217;erhung with wild woods thick&#8217;ning green;</span><br />
 The fragrant birch and hawthorn hoar<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Twined, amorous, round the raptured scene;</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
 The flowers sprang wanton to be prest,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The birds sang love on every spray&mdash;</span><br />
 Till, too, too soon, the glowing west<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Proclaimed the speed of winged day.&rdquo;</span><br />
                                <span style="margin-left: 9em;"><em>To Mary in Heaven</em>.</span></p>
</div>


<p>We were early on the road together; the day, though
somewhat gloomy, was mild and pleasant, and we walked
slowly onward, neither of us in the least disposed to hasten
our parting by hastening our journey. We had discussed
fifty different topics, and were prepared to enter on fifty
more, when we reached the ancient burgh of Ayr, where
our roads separated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have taken an immense liking to you, Mr. Lindsay,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
said my companion, as he seated himself on the parapet of
the old bridge, &ldquo;and have just bethought me of a scheme
through which I may enjoy your company for at least one
night more. The Ayr is a lovely river, and you tell me
you have never explored it. We shall explore it together
this evening for about ten miles, when we shall find ourselves
at the farm-house of Lochlea. You may depend on
a hearty welcome from my father, whom, by the way, I
wish much to introduce to you, as a man worth your
knowing; and, as I have set my heart on the scheme, you
are surely too good-natured to disappoint me.&rdquo; Little
risk of that, I thought; I had, in fact, become thoroughly
enamoured of the warm-hearted benevolence and fascinating
conversation of my companion, and acquiesced with
the best good-will in the world.</p>

<p>We had threaded the course of the river for several
miles. It runs through a wild pastoral valley, roughened
by thickets of copse-wood, and bounded on either hand
by a line of swelling, moory hills, with here and there a
few irregular patches of corn, and here and there some
little nest-like cottage peeping out from among the wood.
The clouds, which during the morning had obscured the
entire face of the heavens, were breaking up their array,
and the sun was looking down, in twenty different places,
through the openings, checkering the landscape with a
fantastic, though lovely carpeting of light and shadow.
Before us there rose a thick wood, on a jutting promontory,
that looked blue and dark in the shade, as if it wore
mourning; while the sunlit stream beyond shone through
the trunks and branches, like a river of fire. At length
the clouds seemed to have melted in the blue&mdash;for there
was not a breath of wind to speed them away&mdash;and the
sun, now hastening to the west, shone in unbroken effulgence
over the wide extent of the dell, lighting up stream
and wood, and field and cottage, in one continuous blaze
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
of glory. We had walked on in silence for the last half
hour; but I could sometimes hear my companion muttering
as he went; and when, in passing through a thicket
of hawthorn and honeysuckle, we started from its perch a
linnet that had been filling the air with its melody, I
could hear him exclaim, in a subdued tone of voice,
&ldquo;Bonny, bonny birdie! why hasten frae me?&mdash;I wadna
skaith a feather o&#8217; yer wing.&rdquo; He turned round to me,
and I could see that his eyes were swimming in moisture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can he be other,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;than a good and benevolent
God, who gives us moments like these to enjoy?
Oh, my friend, without these sabbaths of the soul, that
come to refresh and invigorate it, it would dry up within
us! How exquisite,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;how entire the
sympathy which exists between all that is good and fair in
external nature, and all of good and fair that dwells in our
own! And, oh, how the heart expands and lightens!
The world is as a grave to it&mdash;a closely-covered grave&mdash;and
it shrinks, and deadens, and contracts all its holier and
more joyous feelings under the cold, earth-like pressure.
But, amid the grand and lovely of nature&mdash;amid these
forms and colours of richest beauty&mdash;there is a disinterment,
a resurrection of sentiment; the pressure of our
earthly part seems removed, and those <em>senses of the mind</em>, if
I may so speak, which serve to connect our spirits with
the invisible world around us, recover their proper tone,
and perform their proper office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Senses of the mind</em>,&rdquo; I said, repeating the phrase;
&ldquo;the idea is new to me; but I think I catch your meaning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; there are&mdash;there must be such,&rdquo; he continued,
with growing enthusiasm; &ldquo;man is essentially a religious
creature&mdash;a looker beyond the grave, from the very constitution
of his mind; and the sceptic who denies it is
untrue not merely to the Being who has made and who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
preserves him, but to the entire scope and bent of his own
nature besides. Wherever man is&mdash;whether he be a
wanderer of the wild forest or still wilder desert, a dweller
in some lone isle of the sea, or the tutored and full-minded
denizen of some blessed land like our own&mdash;wherever man
is, there is religion&mdash;hopes that look forward and upward&mdash;the
belief in an unending existence, and a land of separate
souls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was carried away by the enthusiasm of my companion,
and felt, for the time, as if my mind had become the
mirror of his. There seems to obtain among men a species
of moral gravitation, analogous, in its principles, to that
which regulates and controls the movements of the planetary
system. The larger and more ponderous any body,
the greater its attractive force, and the more overpowering
its influence over the lesser bodies which surround it.
The earth we inhabit carries the moon along with it in its
course, and is itself subject to the immensely more powerful
influence of the sun. And it is thus with character.
It is a law of our nature, as certainly as of the system we
inhabit, that the inferior should yield to the superior, and
the lesser owe its guidance to the greater. I had hitherto
wandered on through life almost unconscious of the existence
of this law, or, if occasionally rendered half aware of
it, it was only through a feeling that some secret influence
was operating favourably in my behalf on the common
minds around me. I now felt, however, for the first time,
that I had come in contact with a mind immeasurably
more powerful than my own; my thoughts seemed to
cast themselves into the very mould&mdash;my sentiments to
modulate themselves by the very tone of his. And yet
he was but a russet-clad peasant&mdash;my junior by at least
eight years&mdash;who was returning from school to assist his
father, an humble tacksman, in the labours of the approaching
harvest. But the law of circumstance, so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
arbitrary in ruling the destinies of common men, exerts
but a feeble control over the children of genius. The
prophet went forth commissioned by Heaven to anoint a
king over Israel, and the choice fell on a shepherd boy
who was tending his father&#8217;s flocks in the field.</p>

<p>We had reached a lovely bend of the stream. There
was a semicircular inflection in the steep bank, which
waved over us, from base to summit, with hawthorn and
hazle; and while one half looked blue and dark in the
shade, the other was lighted up with gorgeous and fiery
splendour by the sun, now fast sinking in the west. The
effect seemed magical. A little grassy platform that
stretched between the hanging wood and the stream, was
whitened over with clothes, that looked like snow-wreathes
in the hollow; and a young and beautiful girl watched
beside them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary Campbell!&rdquo; exclaimed my companion, and in a
moment he was at her side, and had grasped both her
hands in his. &ldquo;How fortunate, how very fortunate I
am!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I could not have so much as hoped to
have seen you to-night, and yet here you are! This, Mr.
Lindsay, is a loved friend of mine, whom I have known
and valued for years; ever, indeed, since we herded our
sheep together under the cover of one plaid. Dearest
Mary, I have had sad forebodings regarding you for the
whole last month I was in Kirkoswald, and yet, after all
my foolish fears, here you are, ruddier and bonnier than
ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was, in truth, a beautiful, sylph-like young woman&mdash;one
whom I would have looked at with complacency in
any circumstances; for who that admires the fair and the
lovely in nature&mdash;whether it be the wide-spread beauty
of sky and earth, or beauty in its minuter modifications,
as we see it in the flowers that spring up at our feet, or
the butterfly that flutters over them&mdash;who, I say, that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
admires the fair and lovely in nature, can be indifferent to
the fairest and loveliest of all her productions? As the
mistress, however, of by far the strongest-minded man I
ever knew, there was more of scrutiny in my glance than
usual, and I felt a deeper interest in her than mere beauty
could have awakened. She was, perhaps, rather below
than above the middle size; but formed in such admirable
proportion, that it seemed out of place to think of size in
reference to her at all. Who, in looking at the <em>Venus de
Medicis</em>, asks whether she be tall or short? The bust and
neck were so exquisitely moulded, that they reminded me
of Burke&#8217;s fanciful remark, viz., that our ideas of beauty
originate in our love of the sex, and that we deem every
object beautiful which is described by soft-waving lines,
resembling those of the female neck and bosom. Her feet
and arms, which were both bare, had a statue-like symmetry
and marble-like whiteness; but it was on her expressive
and lovely countenance, now lighted up by the glow
of joyous feeling, that nature seemed to have exhausted
her utmost skill. There was a fascinating mixture in the
expression of superior intelligence and child-like simplicity;
a soft, modest light dwelt in the blue eye; and in
the entire contour and general form of the features, there
was a nearer approach to that union of the straight and
the rounded, which is found in its perfection in only the
Grecian face, than is at all common in our northern latitudes,
among the descendants of either the Celt or the
Saxon. I felt, however, as I gazed, that when lovers meet,
the presence of a third person, however much the friend
of either, must always be less than agreeable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Burns,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;there is a beautiful eminence a
few hundred yards to the right, from which I am desirous
to overlook the windings of the stream. Do permit me to
leave you for a short half hour, when I shall return; or,
lest I weary you by my stay, &#8217;twere better, perhaps, you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
should join me there.&rdquo; My companion greeted the proposal
with a good-humoured smile of intelligence; and, plunging
into the wood, I left him with his Mary. The sun had just
set as he joined me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever been in love, Mr. Lindsay?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, never seriously,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I am, perhaps, not
naturally of the coolest temperament imaginable; but the
same fortune that has improved my mind in some little
degree, and given me high notions of the sex, has hitherto
thrown me among only its less superior specimens. I am
now in my eight-and-twentieth year, and I have not yet
met with a woman whom I could love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are yet a stranger,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;to the
greatest happiness of which our nature is capable. I have
enjoyed more heartfelt pleasure in the company of the
young woman I have just left, than from every other
source that has been opened to me from my childhood
till now. Love, my friend, is the fulfilling of the whole
law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary Campbell, did you not call her?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;She
is, I think, the loveliest creature I have ever seen; and I
am much mistaken in the expression of her beauty, if her
mind be not as lovely as her person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, it is,&rdquo; he exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;the intelligence of an
angel with the simplicity of a child. Oh, the delight of
being thoroughly trusted, thoroughly beloved by one of
the loveliest, best, purest-minded of all God&#8217;s good creatures!
To feel that heart beating against my own, and
to know that it beats for me only! Never have I passed
an evening with my Mary without returning to the world
a better, gentler, wiser man. Love, my friend, is the fulfilling
of the whole law. What are we without it?&mdash;poor,
vile, selfish animals; our very virtues themselves, so exclusively
virtues on our own behalf as to be well nigh as
hateful as our vices. Nothing so opens and improves the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
heart, nothing so widens the grasp of the affections, nothing
half so effectually brings us out of our crust of self, as a
happy, well-regulated love for a pure-minded, affectionate-hearted
woman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is another kind of love, of which we sailors see
somewhat,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;which is not so easily associated with good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love!&rdquo; he replied&mdash;&ldquo;no, Mr. Lindsay, that is not the
name. Kind associates with kind in all nature; and love&mdash;humanizing,
heart-softening love&mdash;cannot be the companion
of whatever is low, mean, worthless, degrading&mdash;the
associate of ruthless dishonour, cunning, treachery,
and violent death. Even independent of its amount of
evil as a crime, or the evils still greater than itself which
necessarily accompany it, there is nothing that so petrifies
the feeling as illicit connection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you seriously think so?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I see clearly how it should be so. Neither
sex is complete of itself&mdash;each was made for the other,
that, like the two halves of a hinge, they may become an
entire whole when united. Only think of the scriptural
phrase, <em>one flesh</em>&mdash;it is of itself a system of philosophy.
Refinement and tenderness are of the woman, strength and
dignity of the man. Only observe the effects of a thorough
separation, whether originating in accident or caprice.
You will find the stronger sex lost in the rudenesses of
partial barbarism; the gentler wrapt up in some pitiful
round of trivial and unmeaning occupation&mdash;dry-nursing
puppies, or making pincushions for posterity. But how
much more pitiful are the effects when they meet amiss&mdash;when
the humanizing friend and companion of the man is
converted into the light degraded toy of an idle hour; the
object of a sordid appetite that lives but for a moment,
and then expires in loathing and disgust! The better
feelings are iced over at their source, chilled by the freezing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
and deadening contact&mdash;where there is nothing to
inspire confidence or solicit esteem; and, if these pass not
through the first, the inner circle&mdash;that circle within which
the social affections are formed, and from whence they
emanate&mdash;how can they possibly flow through the circles
which lie beyond? But here, Mr. Lindsay, is the farm of
Lochlea, and yonder brown cottage, beside the three elms,
is the dwelling of my parents.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<div class="box">
<p style="margin-left: 9em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;From scenes like these old Scotia&#8217;s grandeur springs,</span><br />
 That makes her lov&#8217;d at home, revered abroad.&rdquo;<br />
                               <span style="margin-left: 10em;"><em>Cotter&#8217;s Saturday Night.</em></span></p>
</div>


<p>There was a wide and cheerful circle this evening round
the hospitable hearth of Lochlea. The father of my friend,
a patriarchal-looking old man, with a countenance the
most expressive I have almost ever seen, sat beside the
wall on a large oaken settle, which also served to accommodate
a young man, an occasional visitor of the family,
dressed in rather shabby black, whom I at once set down
as a probationer of divinity. I had my own seat beside
him. The brother of my friend (a lad cast in nearly the
same mould of form and feature, except, perhaps, that his
frame, though muscular and strongly set, seemed in the
main less formidably robust, and his countenance, though
expressive, less decidedly intellectual) sat at my side.
My friend had drawn in his seat beside his mother, a well-formed,
comely brunette, of about thirty-eight, whom I
might almost have mistaken for his elder sister; and two
or three younger members of the family were grouped
behind her. The fire blazed cheerily within the wide and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
open chimney; and, throwing its strong light on the faces
and limbs of the circle, sent our shadows flickering across
the rafters and the wall behind. The conversation was
animated and rational, and every one contributed his share.
But I was chiefly interested in the remarks of the old man,
for whom I already felt a growing veneration, and in those
of his wonderfully-gifted son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unquestionably, Mr. Burns,&rdquo; said the man in black,
addressing the farmer, &ldquo;politeness is but a very shadow,
as the poet hath it, if the heart be wanting. I saw, to-night,
in a strictly polite family, so marked a presumption
of the lack of that natural affection of which politeness is
but the portraiture and semblance, that truly I have been
grieved in my heart ever since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Mr. Murdoch,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;there is ever
more hypocrisy in the world than in the church, and that,
too, among the class of fine gentlemen and fine ladies who
deny it most. But the instance&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know the family, my worthy friend,&rdquo; continued
Mr. Murdoch&mdash;&ldquo;it is a very pretty one, as we say vernacularly,
being numerous, and the sons highly genteel
young men; the daughters not less so. A neighbour of
the same very polite character, coming on a visit when I
was among them, asked the father, in the course of a conversation
to which I was privy, how he meant to dispose
of his sons; when the father replied that he had not yet
determined. The visitor said, that were he in his place,
seeing they were all well-educated young men, he would
send them abroad; to which the father objected the indubitable
fact, that many young men lost their health in
foreign countries, and very many their lives. &lsquo;True,&rsquo; did
the visitor rejoin; &lsquo;but, as you have a number of sons, it
will be strange if some one of them does not live and
make a fortune.&rsquo; Now, Mr. Burns, what will you, who
know the feelings of paternity, and the incalculable, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
assuredly I may say, invaluable value of human souls,
think when I add, that the father commended the hint, as
showing the wisdom of a shrewd man of the world!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even the chief priests,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;pronounced
it unlawful to cast into the treasury the thirty pieces of
silver, seeing it was the price of blood; but the gentility
of the present day is less scrupulous. There is a laxity of
principle among us, Mr. Murdoch, that, if God restore us
not, must end in the ruin of our country. I say laxity
of principle; for there have ever been evil manners among
us, and waifs in no inconsiderable number, broken loose
from the decencies of society&mdash;more, perhaps, in my early
days than there are now. But our principles at least were
sound; and not only was there thus a restorative and conservative
spirit among us, but, what was of not less importance,
there was a broad gulf, like that in the parable,
between the two grand classes, the good and the evil&mdash;a
gulf which, when it secured the better class from contamination,
interposed no barrier to the reformation and return
of even the most vile and profligate, if repentant. But
this gulf has disappeared, and we are standing unconcernedly
over it, on a hollow and dangerous marsh of neutral
ground, which, in the end, if God open not our eyes, must
assuredly give way under our feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To what, father,&rdquo; inquired my friend, who sat listening
with the deepest and most respectful attention, &ldquo;do
you attribute the change?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; replied the old man, &ldquo;there have been
many causes at work; and, though not impossible, it
would certainly be no easy task to trace them all to their
several effects, and give to each its due place and importance.
But there is a deadly evil among us, though you
will hear of it from neither press nor pulpit, which I am
disposed to rank first in the number&mdash;the affectation of
gentility. It has a threefold influence among us: it confounds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the grand eternal distinctions of right and wrong,
by erecting into a standard of conduct and opinion that
heterogeneous and artificial whole which constitutes the
manners and morals of the upper classes; it severs those
ties of affection and good-will which should bind the
middle to the lower orders, by disposing the one to regard
whatever is below them with a true contemptuous indifference,
and by provoking a bitter and indignant, though
natural jealousy in the other for being so regarded; and,
finally, by leading those who most entertain it into habits
of expense, torturing their means, if I may so speak, on
the rack of false opinion&mdash;disposing them to think, in their
blindness, that to be genteel is a first consideration, and to
be honest merely a secondary one&mdash;it has the effect of so
hardening their hearts, that, like those Carthaginians of
whom we have been lately reading in the volume Mr.
Murdoch lent us, they offer up their very children, souls
and bodies, to the unreal, phantom-like necessities of their
circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I not heard you remark, father,&rdquo; said Gilbert
&ldquo;that the change you describe has been very marked
among the ministers of our church?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too marked and too striking,&rdquo; replied the old man;
&ldquo;and in affecting the respectability and usefulness of so
important a class, it has educed a cause of deterioration,
distinctly from itself, and hardly less formidable. There
is an old proverb of our country&mdash;&lsquo;Better the head of the
commonality than the tail of the gentry.&rsquo; I have heard
you quote it, Robert, oftener than once, and admire its
homely wisdom. Now, it bears directly on what I have
to remark&mdash;the ministers of our church have moved but
one step during the last sixty years; but that step has
been an all-important one&mdash;it has been from the best
place in relation to the people, to the worst in relation to
the aristocracy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
&ldquo;Undoubtedly, worthy Mr. Burns,&rdquo; said Mr. Murdoch,
&ldquo;there is great truth, according to mine own experience,
in that which you affirm. I may state, I trust, without
over-boasting or conceit, my respected friend, that my
learning is not inferior to that of our neighbour the
clergyman&mdash;it is not inferior in Latin, nor in Greek, nor
yet in French literature, Mr. Burns, and probable it is he
would not much court a competition, and yet, when I last
waited at the manse regarding a necessary and essential
certificate, Mr. Burns, he did not so much as ask me to sit
down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Gilbert, who seemed the wit of the family,
&ldquo;he is a highly respectable man, Mr. Murdoch&mdash;he has a
fine house, fine furniture, fine carpets&mdash;all that constitutes
respectability, you know; and his family is on visiting
terms with that of the laird. But his credit is not so
respectable, I hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gilbert,&rdquo; said the old man, with much seriousness, &ldquo;it
is ill with a people when they can speak lightly of their
clergymen. There is still much of sterling worth and
serious piety in the Church of Scotland; and if the influence
of its ministers be unfortunately less than it was
once, we must not cast the blame too exclusively on themselves.
Other causes have been in operation. The church,
eighty years ago, was the sole guide of opinion, and the
only source of thought among us. There was, indeed, but
one way in which a man could learn to think. His mind
became the subject of some serious impression:&mdash;he applied
to his Bible, and, in the contemplation of the most important
of all concerns, his newly awakened faculties received
their first exercise. All of intelligence, all of moral
good in him, all that rendered him worthy of the name of
man, he owed to the ennobling influence of his church;
and is it wonder that that influence should be all-powerful
from this circumstance alone? But a thorough change
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
has taken place;&mdash;new sources of intelligence have been
opened up; we have our newspapers, and our magazines,
and our volumes of miscellaneous reading; and it is now
possible enough for the most cultivated mind in a parish
to be the least moral and the least religious; and hence
necessarily a diminished influence in the church, independent
of the character of its ministers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have dwelt too long, perhaps, on the conversation of
the elder Burns; but I feel much pleasure in thus developing,
as it were, my recollections of one whom his powerful-minded
son has described&mdash;and this after an acquaintance
with our Henry Mackenzies, Adam Smiths, and Dugald
Stewarts&mdash;as the man most thoroughly acquainted with the
world he ever knew. Never, at least, have I met with
any one who exerted a more wholesome influence, through
the force of moral character, on those around him. We sat
down to a plain and homely supper. The slave question
had, about this time, begun to draw the attention of a few
of the more excellent and intelligent among the people,
and the elder Burns seemed deeply interested in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is but homely fare, Mr. Lindsay,&rdquo; he said, pointing
to the simple viands before us, &ldquo;and the apologists of
slavery among us would tell you how inferior we are to
the poor negroes, who fare so much better. But surely
&lsquo;man liveth not by bread alone!&rsquo; Our fathers who died
for Christ on the hillside and the scaffold were noble men,
and never, never shall slavery produce such, and yet they
toiled as hard, and fared as meanly as we their children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could feel, in the cottage of such a peasant, and seated
beside such men as his two sons, the full force of the remark.
And yet I have heard the miserable sophism of
unprincipled power against which it was directed&mdash;a
sophism so insulting to the dignity of honest poverty&mdash;a
thousand times repeated.</p>

<p>Supper over, the family circle widened round the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
hearth; and the old man, taking down a large clasped
Bible, seated himself beside the iron lamp which now
lighted the apartment. There was deep silence among us
as he turned over the leaves. Never shall I forget his
appearance. He was tall and thin, and though his frame
was still vigorous, considerably bent. His features were
high and massy&mdash;the complexion still retained much of
the freshness of youth, and the eye all its intelligence; but
the locks were waxing thin and grey round his high,
thoughtful forehead, and the upper part of the head, which
was elevated to an unusual height, was bald. There was
an expression of the deepest seriousness on the countenance,
which the strong umbery shadows of the apartment
served to heighten; and when, laying his hand on the
page, he half turned his face to the circle, and said, &ldquo;<em>Let
us worship God</em>,&rdquo; I was impressed by a feeling of awe and
reverence to which I had, alas! been a stranger for years.
I was affected too, almost to tears, as I joined in the psalm;
for a thousand half-forgotten associations came rushing
upon me; and my heart seemed to swell and expand as,
kneeling beside him when he prayed, I listened to his
solemn and fervent petition, that God might make manifest
his great power and goodness in the salvation of man. Nor
was the poor solitary wanderer of the deep forgotten.</p>

<p>On rising from our devotions, the old man grasped me
by the hand. &ldquo;I am happy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that we should
have met, Mr. Lindsay. I feel an interest in you, and
must take the friend and the old man&#8217;s privilege of giving
you an advice. The sailor, of all men, stands most in need
of religion. His life is one of continued vicissitude&mdash;of
unexpected success, or unlooked-for misfortune; he is
ever passing from danger to safety, and from safety to
danger; his dependence is on the ever-varying winds, his
abode on the unstable waters. And the mind takes a
peculiar tone from what is peculiar in the circumstances.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
With nothing stable in the real world around it on which
it may rest, it forms a resting-place for itself in some wild
code of belief. It peoples the elements with strange occult
powers of good and evil, and does them homage&mdash;addressing
its prayers to the genius of the winds, and the spirits
of the waters. And thus it begets a religion for itself;&mdash;for
what else is the professional superstition of the sailor?
Substitute, my friend, for this&mdash;(shall I call it unavoidable
superstition?)&mdash;this natural religion of the sea, the religion
of the Bible. Since you must be a believer in the supernatural,
let your belief be true; let your trust be on Him
who faileth not&mdash;your anchor within the vail; and all shall
be well, be your destiny for this world what it may.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We parted for the night, and I saw him no more.</p>

<p>Next morning, Robert accompanied me for several miles
on my way. I saw, for the last half hour, that he had
something to communicate, and yet knew not how to set
about it; and so I made a full stop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have something to tell me, Mr. Burns,&rdquo; I said:
&ldquo;need I assure you I am one you are in no danger from
trusting.&rdquo; He blushed deeply, and I saw him, for the first
time, hesitate and falter in his address.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he at length said&mdash;&ldquo;believe me, Mr.
Lindsay, I would be the last in the world to hurt the feelings
of a friend&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;but you have been left among us
penniless, and I have a very little money which I have no
use for&mdash;none in the least;&mdash;will you not favour me by
accepting it as a loan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt the full and generous delicacy of the proposal,
and, with moistened eyes and a swelling heart, availed
myself of his kindness. The sum he tendered did not
much exceed a guinea; but the yearly earnings of the
peasant Burns fell, at this period of his life, rather below
eight pounds.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<div class="box">
<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
&ldquo;Corbies an&#8217; clergy are a shot right kittle.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Brigs of Ayr</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>The years passed, and I was again a dweller on the sea;
but the ill-fortune which had hitherto tracked me like a
bloodhound, seemed at length as if tired in the pursuit, and
I was now the master of a West India trader, and had
begun to lay the foundation of that competency which has
secured to my declining years the quiet and comfort which,
for the latter part of my life, it has been my happiness to
enjoy. My vessel had arrived at Liverpool in the latter
part of the year 1784, and I had taken coach for Irvine,
to visit my mother, whom I had not seen for several years.
There was a change of passengers at every stage; but I
saw little in any of them to interest me, till within about a
score of miles of my destination, when I met with an old
respectable townsman, a friend of my father&#8217;s. There was
but another passenger in the coach, a north country
gentleman from the West Indies. I had many questions
to ask my townsman, and many to answer&mdash;and the time
passed lightly away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me aught of the Burnses of Lochlea?&rdquo; I
inquired, after learning that my mother and other relatives
were well. &ldquo;I met with the young man Robert
about five years ago, and have often since asked myself
what special end providence could have in view in making
such a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was acquainted with old William Burns,&rdquo; said my
companion, &ldquo;when he was gardener at Denholm, an&#8217; got
intimate wi&#8217; his son Robert when he lived wi&#8217; us at
Irvine, a twalmonth syne. The faither died shortly ago,
sairly straitened in his means, I&#8217;m feared, and no very
square wi&#8217; the laird&mdash;an&#8217; ill wad he hae liked that, for an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
honester man never breathed. Robert, puir chield, is no
very easy either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In his circumstances?&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, an&#8217; waur:&mdash;he got entangled wi&#8217; the kirk on an
unlucky sculduddery business, an&#8217; has been writing bitter,
wicked ballads on a&#8217; the guid ministers in the country
ever syne. I&#8217;m vexed it&#8217;s on them he suld hae fallen; an&#8217;
yet they hae been to blame too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robert Burns so entangled, so occupied!&rdquo; I exclaimed;
&ldquo;you grieve and astonish me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are puir creatures, Matthew,&rdquo; said the old man;
&ldquo;strength an&#8217; weakness are often next door neighbours in
the best o&#8217; us; nay, what is our vera strength taen on the
ae side, may be our vera weakness taen on the ither.
Never was there a stancher, firmer fallow than Robert
Burns; an&#8217; now that he has taen a wrang step, puir chield,
that vera stanchness seems just a weak want o&#8217; ability to
yield. He has planted his foot where it lighted by
mishanter, and a&#8217; the guid an&#8217; ill in Scotland wadna
budge him frae the spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me! that so powerful a mind should be so frivolously
engaged! Making ballads, you say?&mdash;with what success?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Matthew lad, when the strong man puts out his
strength,&rdquo; said my companion, &ldquo;there&#8217;s naething frivolous
in the matter, be his object what it may. Robert&#8217;s ballads
are far, far aboon the best things ever seen in Scotland
afore; we auld folk dinna ken whether maist to blame or
praise them, but they keep the young people laughing frae
the ae nuik o&#8217; the shire till the ither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how,&rdquo; I inquired, &ldquo;have the better clergy rendered
themselves obnoxious to Burns? The laws he has
violated, if I rightly understand you, are indeed severe,
and somewhat questionable in their tendencies; and even
good men often press them too far.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
&ldquo;And in the case of Robert,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;our
clergy have been strict to the very letter. They&#8217;re guid
men an&#8217; faithfu&#8217; ministers; but ane o&#8217; them, at least, an&#8217; he
a leader, has a harsh, ill temper, an&#8217; mistakes sometimes
the corruption o&#8217; the auld man in him for the proper zeal
o&#8217; the new ane. Nor is there ony o&#8217; the ithers wha kent
what they had to deal wi&#8217; when Robert cam afore them.
They saw but a proud, thrawart ploughman, that stood
uncow&#8217;ring under the glunsh o&#8217; a hail session; and so they
opened on him the artillery o&#8217; the kirk, to bear down his
pride. Wha could hae told them that they were but
frushing their straw an&#8217; rotten wood against the iron scales
o&#8217; Leviathan? An&#8217; now that they hae dune their maist,
the record o&#8217; Robert&#8217;s mishanter is lying in whity-brown
ink yonder in a page o&#8217; the session-buik, while the ballads
hae sunk deep deep intil the very mind o&#8217; the country,
and may live there for hunders and hunders o&#8217; years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to contrast, in this business,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;our
better with what you must deem our inferior clergy. You
mean, do you not, the higher and lower parties in our
church? How are they getting on now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never worse,&rdquo; replied the old man; &ldquo;an&#8217;, oh, it&#8217;s surely
ill when the ministers o&#8217; peace become the very leaders o&#8217;
contention! But let the blame rest in the right place.
Peace is surely a blessing frae Heaven&mdash;no a guid wark
demanded frae man; an&#8217; when it grows our duty to be in
war, it&#8217;s an ill thing to be in peace. Our Evangelicals are
stan&#8217;in&#8217;, puir folk, whar their faithers stood; an&#8217; if they
maun either fight or be beaten frae their post, why, it&#8217;s
just their duty to fight. But the Moderates are rinnin&#8217;
mad a&#8217;thegither amang us: signing our auld Confession,
just that they may get intil the kirk to preach against it;
paring the New Testament doun to the vera standard o&#8217;
heathen Plawto; and sinking ae doctrine after anither, till
they leave ahint naething but deism that might scunner
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
an infidel. Deed, Matthew, if there comena a change
among them, an&#8217; that sune, they&#8217;ll swamp the puir kirk
a&#8217; thegither. The cauld morality that never made ony ane
mair moral, taks nae hand o&#8217; the people; an&#8217; patronage, as
meikle&#8217;s they roose it, winna keep up either kirk or manse
o&#8217; itsel. Sorry I am, sin&#8217; Robert has entered on the quarrel
at a&#8217;, it suld hae been on the wrang side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of my chief objections,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;to the religion
of the Moderate party is, that it is of no use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A gey serious ane,&rdquo; rejoined the old man; &ldquo;but maybe
there&#8217;s a waur still. I&#8217;m unco vexed for Robert, baith
on his worthy faither&#8217;s account and his ain. He&#8217;s a fearsome
fellow when ance angered, but an honest, warm-hearted
chield for a&#8217; that; an&#8217; there&#8217;s mair sense in yon
big head o&#8217; his, than in ony ither twa in the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me aught,&rdquo; said the north country gentleman,
addressing my companion, &ldquo;of Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;, the chapel
minister in K&mdash;&mdash;? I was once one of his pupils in the
far north; but I have heard nothing of him since he left
Cromarty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; rejoined the old man, &ldquo;he&#8217;s just the man that,
mair nor a&#8217; the rest, has borne the brunt o&#8217; Robert&#8217;s fearsome
waggery. Did ye ken him in Cromarty, say ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was parish schoolmaster there,&rdquo; said the gentleman,
&ldquo;for twelve years; and for six of these I attended
his school. I cannot help respecting him; but no one
ever loved him. Never surely was there a man at once so
unequivocally honest and so thoroughly unamiable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have found him a rigid disciplinarian,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was the most so,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;from the days of
Dionysius, at least, that ever taught a school. I remember
there was a poor fisher boy among us named Skinner, who,
as is customary in Scottish schools, as you must know,
blew the horn for gathering the scholars, and kept the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
catalogue and the key; and who, in return, was educated
by the master, and received some little gratuity from the
scholars besides. On one occasion, the key dropped out
of his pocket; and, when school-time came, the irascible
dominie had to burst open the door with his foot. He
raged at the boy with a fury so insane, and beat him so
unmercifully, that the other boys, gathering heart in the
extremity of the case, had to rise <em>en masse</em> and tear him
out of his hands. But the curious part of the story is yet
to come: Skinner has been a fisherman for the last twelve
years; but never has he been seen disengaged, for a
moment, from that time to this, without mechanically
thrusting his hand into the key pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our companion furnished us with two or three other
anecdotes of Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;. He told us of a lady who was so
overcome by sudden terror on unexpectedly seeing him,
many years after she had quitted his school, in one of the
pulpits of the south, that she fainted away; and of another
of his scholars, named M&#699;Glashan, a robust, daring fellow
of six feet, who, when returning to Cromarty from some
of the colonies, solaced himself by the way with thoughts
of the hearty drubbing with which he was to clear off all
his old scores with the dominie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ere his return, however,&rdquo; continued the gentleman,
&ldquo;Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;had quitted the parish; and, had it chanced
otherwise, it is questionable whether M&#699;Glashan, with all
his strength and courage, would have gained anything in
an encounter with one of the boldest and most powerful
men in the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such were some of the chance glimpses which I gained,
at this time, of by far the most powerful of the opponents
of Burns. He was a good, conscientious man; but unfortunate
in a harsh, violent temper, and in sometimes mistaking,
as my old townsman remarked, the dictates of that
temper for those of duty.</p>

</div>

<p>I visited my friend, a few days after my arrival in Irvine,
at the farm-house of Mossgiel, to which, on the death of
his father, he had removed, with his brother Gilbert and his
mother. I could not help observing that his manners were
considerably changed: my welcome seemed less kind and
hearty than I could have anticipated from the warm-hearted
peasant of five years ago, and there was a stern and almost
supercilious elevation in his bearing, which at first pained
and offended me. I had met with him as he was returning
from the fields after the labours of the day; the dusk of
twilight had fallen; and, though I had calculated on passing
the evening with him at the farm-house of Mossgiel, so displeased
was I, that, after our first greeting, I had more
than half changed my mind. The recollection of his former
kindness to me, however, suspended the feeling, and I
resolved on throwing myself on his hospitality for the night,
however cold the welcome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come all the way from Irvine to see you, Mr.
Burns,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;For the last five years, I have thought
more of my mother and you than of any other two persons
in the country. May I not calculate, as of old, on my
supper and a bed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was an instantaneous change in his expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, my friend,&rdquo; he said, grasping my hand;
&ldquo;I have, unwittingly, been doing you wrong; one may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
surely be the master of an Indiaman and in possession of
a heart too honest to be spoiled by prosperity!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The remark served to explain the haughty coldness of
his manner which had so displeased me, and which was
but the unwillingly assumed armour of a defensive pride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, brother,&rdquo; he said, throwing down some plough
irons which he carried, &ldquo;send <em>wee Davoc</em> with these to the
smithy, and bid him tell Rankin I won&#8217;t be there to-night.
The moon is rising, Mr. Lindsay&mdash;shall we not have a stroll
together through the coppice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That of all things,&rdquo; I replied; and, parting from Gilbert,
we struck into the wood.</p>

<p>The evening, considering the lateness of the season, for
winter had set in, was mild and pleasant. The moon at
full was rising over the Cumnock hills, and casting its
faint light on the trees that rose around us, in their
winding-sheets of brown and yellow, like so many spectres, or
that, in the more exposed glares and openings of the
wood, stretched their long naked arms to the sky. A
light breeze went rustling through the withered grass;
and I could see the faint twinkling of the falling leaves, as
they came showering down on every side of us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We meet in the midst of death and desolation,&rdquo; said
my companion&mdash;&ldquo;we parted when all around us was fresh
and beautiful. My father was with me then, and&mdash;and
Mary Campbell&mdash;and now&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary! your Mary!&rdquo; I exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;the young&mdash;the
beautiful&mdash;alas! is she also gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has left me,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;left me. Mary is in her grave!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt my heart swell, as the image of that loveliest of
creatures came rising to my view in all her beauty, as I
had seen her by the river side; and I knew not what to
reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued my friend, &ldquo;she&#8217;s in her grave;&mdash;we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
parted for a few days, to re-unite, as we hoped, for ever;
and, ere these few days had passed, she was in her grave.
But I was unworthy of her&mdash;unworthy even then; and
now&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;But she is in her grave!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I grasped his hand. &ldquo;It is difficult,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;to <em>bid</em> the
heart submit to these dispensations, and, oh, how utterly
impossible to bring it to <em>listen</em>! But life&mdash;<em>your</em> life, my
friend&mdash;must not be passed in useless sorrow. I am convinced,
and often have I thought of it since our last meeting,
that yours is no vulgar destiny&mdash;though I know not
to what it tends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Downwards!&rdquo; he exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;it tends downwards;&mdash;I
see, I feel it;&mdash;the anchor of my affection is gone, and I
drift shoreward on the rocks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8217;Twere ruin,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;to think so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not half an hour ere my father died,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;he expressed a wish to rise and sit once more in his
chair; and we indulged him. But, alas! the same feeling
of uneasiness which had prompted the wish, remained with
him still, and he sought to return again to his bed. &lsquo;It is
not by quitting the bed or the chair,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that I need
seek for ease: it is by quitting the body.&rsquo; I am oppressed,
Mr. Lindsay, by a somewhat similar feeling of uneasiness,
and, at times, would fain cast the blame on the circumstances
in which I am placed. But I may be as far
mistaken as my poor father. I would fain live at peace
with all mankind&mdash;nay, more, I would fain love and do
good to them all; but the villain and the oppressor come
to set their feet on my very neck, and crush me into the mire&mdash;and
must I not resist? And when, in some luckless
hour, I yield to my passions&mdash;to those fearful passions
that must one day overwhelm me&mdash;when I yield, and my
whole mind is darkened by remorse, and I groan under
the discipline of conscience, then comes the odious, abominable
hypocrite&mdash;the devourer of widows&#8217; houses and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
substance of the orphan&mdash;and demands that my repentance
be as public as his own hollow, detestable prayers. And
can I do other than resist and expose him? My heart
tells me it was formed to bestow&mdash;why else does every
misery that I cannot relieve render me wretched? It
tells me, too, it was formed not to receive&mdash;why else
does the proffered assistance of even a friend fill my
whole soul with indignation? But ill do my circumstances
agree with my feelings. I feel as if I were
totally misplaced in some frolic of nature, and wander
onwards in gloom and unhappiness, seeking for my proper
sphere. But, alas! these efforts of uneasy misery
are but the blind gropings of Homer&#8217;s Cyclops round the
walls of his cave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I again began to experience, as on a former occasion,
the o&#8217;ermastering power of a mind larger beyond comparison
than my own; but I felt it my duty to resist the
influence. &ldquo;Yes, you are misplaced, my friend,&rdquo; I said&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps
more decidedly so than any other man I ever
knew; but is not this characteristic, in some measure, of
the whole species? We are all misplaced; and it seems
a part of the scheme of deity, that we should work ourselves
up to our proper sphere. In what other respect
does man so differ from the inferior animals as in those
aspirations which lead him through all the progressions of
improvement, from the lowest to the highest level of his
nature?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may be philosophy, my friend,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but
a heart ill at ease finds little of comfort in it. You knew
my father: need I say he was one of the excellent of the
earth&mdash;a man who held directly from God Almighty the
patent of his honours? I saw that father sink broken-hearted
into the grave, the victim of legalized oppression&mdash;yes,
saw him overborne in the long contest which his
high spirit and his indomitable love of the right had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
incited him to maintain&mdash;overborne by a mean, despicable
scoundrel, one of the creeping things of the earth. Heaven
knows I did my utmost to assist in the struggle. In my
fifteenth year, Mr. Lindsay, when a thin, loose-jointed boy,
I did the work of a man, and strained my unknit and
overtoiled sinews as if life and death depended on the
issue, till oft, in the middle of the night, I have had to
fling myself from my bed to avoid instant suffocation&mdash;an
effect of exertion so prolonged and so premature. Nor has
the man exerted himself less heartily than the boy&mdash;in the
roughest, severest labours of the field, I have never yet
met a competitor. But my labours have been all in vain&mdash;I
have seen the evil bewailed by Solomon&mdash;the righteous
man falling down before the wicked.&rdquo; I could answer only
with a sigh. &ldquo;You are in the right,&rdquo; he continued, after
a pause, and in a more subdued tone: &ldquo;man is certainly
misplaced&mdash;the present scene of things is below the dignity
of both his moral and intellectual nature. Look round
you&mdash;(we had reached the summit of a grassy eminence
which rose over the wood, and commanded a pretty extensive
view of the surrounding country)&mdash;see yonder scattered
cottages, that, in the faint light, rise dim and black
amid the stubble fields&mdash;my heart warms as I look on
them, for I know how much of honest worth, and sound,
generous feeling shelters under these roof-trees. But why
so much of moral excellence united to a mere machinery
for ministering to the ease and luxury of a few of, perhaps,
the least worthy of our species&mdash;creatures so spoiled by
prosperity that the claim of a common nature has no force
to move them, and who seem as miserably misplaced as the
myriads whom they oppress?&rdquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;If I&#8217;m designed yon lordling&#8217;s slave&mdash;</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">By nature&#8217;s law designed&mdash;</span><br />
 Why was an independent wish<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">E&#8217;er planted in my mind?</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
 If not, why am I subject to<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">His cruelty and scorn?</span><br />
 Or why has man the will and power<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">To make his fellow mourn?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I would hardly know what to say in return, my friend,&rdquo;
I rejoined, &ldquo;did not you, yourself, furnish me with the
reply. You are groping on in darkness, and it may be
unhappiness, for your proper sphere; but it is in obedience
to a great though occult law of our nature&mdash;a law, general
as it affects the species, in its course of onward
progression&mdash;particular,
and infinitely more irresistible, as it operates
on every truly superior intellect. There are men born to
wield the destinies of nations&mdash;nay, more, to stamp the
impression of their thoughts and feelings on the mind of
the whole civilized world. And by what means do we
often find them roused to accomplish their appointed work?
At times hounded on by sorrow and suffering, and thus in
the design of providence, that there may be less of sorrow
and suffering in the world ever after&mdash;at times roused by
cruel and maddening oppression, that the oppressor may
perish in his guilt, and a whole country enjoy the blessings
of freedom. If Wallace had not suffered from tyranny,
Scotland would not have been free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how apply the remark?&rdquo; said my companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robert Burns,&rdquo; I replied, again grasping his hand,
&ldquo;yours, I am convinced, is no vulgar destiny. Your
griefs, your sufferings, your errors even, the oppressions
you have seen and felt, the thoughts which have arisen
in your mind, the feelings and sentiments of which it
has been the subject, are, I am convinced, of infinitely
more importance in their relation to your country than
to yourself. You are, wisely and benevolently, placed far
below your level, that thousands and ten thousands of
your countrymen may be the better enabled to attain to
theirs. Assert the dignity of manhood and of genius, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
there will be less of wrong and oppression in the world
ever after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I spent the remainder of the evening in the farm-house
of Mossgiel, and took the coach next morning for Liverpool.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<div class="box">
<p style="margin-left: 10em;">

</div>

<p>The love of literature, when once thoroughly awakened
in a reflective mind, can never after cease to influence it.
It first assimilates our intellectual part to those fine intellects
which live in the world of books, and then renders
our connection with them indispensable, by laying hold of
that social principle of our nature which ever leads us to
the society of our fellows as our proper sphere of enjoyment.
My early habits, by heightening my tone of thought
and feeling, had tended considerably to narrow my circle
of companionship. My profession, too, had led me to be
much alone; and now that I had been several years the
master of an Indiaman, I was quite as fond of reading, and
felt as deep an interest in whatever took place in the
literary world, as when a student at St. Andrew&#8217;s. There
was much in the literature of the period to gratify my
pride as a Scotchman. The despotism, both political and
religious, which had overlaid the energies of our country
for more than a century, had long been removed, and the
national mind had swelled and expanded under a better
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
system of things, till its influence had become co-extensive
with civilized man. Hume had produced his inimitable
history, and Adam Smith his wonderful work, which was
to revolutionise and new-model the economy of all the
governments of the earth. And there, in my little library,
were the histories of Henry and Robertson, the philosophy
of Kaimes and Reid, the novels of Smollett and Mackenzie,
and the poetry of Beattie and Home. But, if there was
no lack of Scottish intellect in the literature of the time,
there was a decided lack of Scottish manners; and I knew
too much of my humble countrymen not to regret it. True,
I had before me the writings of Ramsay and my unfortunate
friend Ferguson; but there was a radical meanness
in the first that lowered the tone of his colouring far beneath
the freshness of truth, and the second, whom I had
seen perish&mdash;too soon, alas! for literature and his country&mdash;had
given us but a few specimens of his power when
his hand was arrested for ever.</p>

<p>My vessel, after a profitable, though somewhat tedious
voyage, had again arrived in Liverpool. It was late in
December, 1786, and I was passing the long evening in
my cabin, engaged with a whole sheaf of pamphlets and
magazines which had been sent me from the shore. <em>The
Lounger</em> was, at this time, in course of publication. I had
ever been an admirer of the quiet elegance and exquisite
tenderness of Mackenzie; and, though I might not be
quite disposed to think, with Johnson, that &ldquo;the chief
glory of every people arises from its authors,&rdquo; I certainly
felt all the prouder of my country, from the circumstance
that so accomplished a writer was one of my countrymen.
I had read this evening some of the more recent numbers,
half disposed to regret, however, amid all the pleasure
they afforded me, that the Addison of Scotland had not
done for the manners of his country what his illustrious
prototype had done for those of England, when my eye fell
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
on the ninety-seventh number. I read the introductory
sentences, and admired their truth and elegance. I had
felt, in the contemplation of supereminent genius, the pleasure
which the writer describes, and my thoughts reverted
to my two friends&mdash;the dead and the living. &ldquo;In the
view of highly superior talents, as in that of great and
stupendous objects,&rdquo; says the essayist, &ldquo;there is a sublimity
which fills the soul with wonder and delight&mdash;which
expands it, as it were, beyond its usual bounds, and which,
investing our nature with extraordinary powers and extraordinary
honours, interests our curiosity and flatters our
pride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I read on with increasing interest. It was evident, from
the tone of the introduction, that some new luminary had
arisen in the literary horizon, and I felt somewhat like a
schoolboy when, at his first play, he waits for the drawing
up of the curtain. And the curtain at length rose. &ldquo;The
person,&rdquo; continues the essayist, &ldquo;to whom I allude&rdquo;&mdash;and
he alludes to him as a genius of no ordinary class&mdash;&ldquo;is
Robert Burns, an Ayrshire ploughman.&rdquo; The effect on my
nerves seemed electrical; I clapped my hands, and sprung
from my seat: &ldquo;Was I not certain of it! Did I not foresee
it!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;My noble-minded friend, Robert
Burns!&rdquo; I ran hastily over the warm-hearted and generous
critique, so unlike the cold, timid, equivocal notices
with which the professional critic has greeted, on their
first appearance, so many works destined to immortality.
It was Mackenzie, the discriminating, the classical, the
elegant, who assured me that the productions of this
&ldquo;heaven-taught ploughman were fraught with the high-toned
feeling and the power and energy of expression
characteristic of the mind and voice of the poet&rdquo;&mdash;with
the solemn, the tender, the sublime; that they contained
images of pastoral beauty which no other writer had ever
surpassed, and strains of wild humour which only the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
higher masters of the lyre had ever equalled; and that the
genius displayed in them seemed not less admirable in
tracing the manners than in painting the passions, or in
drawing the scenery of nature. I flung down the essay,
ascended to the deck in three huge strides, leaped ashore,
and reached my bookseller&#8217;s as he was shutting up for
the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you furnish me with a copy of Burns&#8217; Poems,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;either for love or money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have but one copy left,&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;and here it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I flung down a guinea. &ldquo;The change,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I shall
get when I am less in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#8217;Twas late that evening ere I remembered that &#8217;tis customary
to spend at least part of the night in bed. I read
on and on with a still increasing astonishment and delight,
laughing and crying by turns. I was quite in a new world;
all was fresh and unsoiled&mdash;the thoughts, the descriptions,
the images&mdash;as if the volume I read was the first that had
ever been written; and yet all was easy and natural, and
appealed, with a truth and force irresistible, to the
recollections I cherished most fondly. Nature and Scotland
met me at every turn. I had admired the polished compositions
of Pope, and Gray, and Collins, though I could
not sometimes help feeling that, with all the exquisite art
they displayed, there was a little additional art wanting
still. In most cases the scaffolding seemed incorporated
with the structure which it had served to rear; and,
though certainly no scaffolding could be raised on surer
principles, I could have wished that the ingenuity which
had been tasked to erect it, had been exerted a little further
in taking it down. But the work before me was evidently
the production of a greater artist; not a fragment of
the scaffolding remained&mdash;not so much as a mark to show
how it had been constructed. The whole seemed to have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
risen like an exhalation, and, in this respect, reminded me
of the structures of Shakspeare alone. I read the inimitable
&ldquo;Twa Dogs.&rdquo; Here, I said, is the full and perfect
realization of what Swift and Dryden were hardy enough
to attempt, but lacked genius to accomplish. Here are
dogs&mdash;<em>bona fide</em> dogs&mdash;endowed indeed with more than
human sense and observation, but true to character, as
the most honest and attached of quadrupeds, in every line.
And then those exquisite touches which the poor man,
inured to a life of toil and poverty, can alone rightly
understand! and those deeply-based remarks on character,
which only the philosopher can justly appreciate! This
is the true catholic poetry, which addresses itself not to
any little circle, walled in from the rest of the species by
some peculiarity of thought, prejudice, or condition,
but to the whole human family. I read
on:&mdash;&ldquo;The Holy Fair,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hallow E&#8217;en,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Vision,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Address to the Deil,&rdquo; engaged me by turns; and then the
strange, uproarious, unequalled &ldquo;Death and Dr. Hornbook.&rdquo;
This, I said, is something new in the literature of the world.
Shakspeare possessed above all men the power of instant
and yet natural transition, from the lightly gay to the
deeply pathetic&mdash;from the wild to the humorous; but the
opposite states of feeling which he induces, however close
the neighbourhood, are ever distinct and separate; the
oil and the water, though contained in the same vessel,
remain apart. Here, however, for the first time, they mix
and incorporate, and yet each retains its whole nature and
full effect. I need hardly remind the reader that the feat
has been repeated, and even with more completeness, in
the wonderful, &ldquo;Tam o&#8217; Shanter.&rdquo; I read on. &ldquo;The
Cotter&#8217;s Saturday Night&rdquo; filled my whole soul&mdash;my heart
throbbed and my eyes moistened; and never before did I
feel half so proud of my country, or know half so well on
what score it was I did best in feeling proud. I had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
perused the entire volume from beginning to end, ere I
remembered I had not taken supper, and that it was more
than time to go to bed.</p>

<p>But it is no part of my plan to furnish a critique on the
poems of my friend. I merely strive to recall the thoughts
and feelings which my first perusal of them awakened, and
thus only as a piece of mental history. Several months
elapsed from this evening ere I could hold them out from
me sufficiently at arms&#8217; length, as it were, to judge of their
more striking characteristics. At times the amazing amount
of thought, feeling, and imagery which they contained&mdash;their
wonderful continuity of idea, without gap or interstice&mdash;seemed
to me most to distinguish them. At times
they reminded me, compared with the writings of smoother
poets, of a collection of medals which, unlike the thin
polished coin of the kingdom, retained all the significant
and pictorial roughness of the original die. But when,
after the lapse of weeks, months, years, I found them rising
up in my heart on every occasion, as naturally as if they
had been the original language of all my feelings and
emotions&mdash;when I felt that, instead of remaining outside
my mind, as it were, like the writings of other poets, they
had so amalgamated themselves with my passions, my
sentiments, my ideas, that they seemed to have become
portions of my very self&mdash;I was led to a final conclusion
regarding them. Their grand distinguishing characteristic
is their unswerving and perfect truth. The poetry of
Shakspeare is the mirror of life&mdash;that of Burns the expressive
and richly modulated voice of human nature.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Burns was a poor man from his birth, and an exciseman from
necessity; but&mdash;I <em>will say</em> it!&mdash;the sterling of his
honest worth, poverty could not debase; and his independent
British spirit oppression might bend, but could not
subdue.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Letter to Mr. Graham</em>.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have been listening for the last half hour to the wild
music of an Eolian harp. How exquisitely the tones rise
and fall!&mdash;now sad, now solemn&mdash;now near, now distant.
The nerves thrill, the heart softens, the imagination awakes
as we listen. What if that delightful instrument be animated
by a living soul, and these finely-modulated tones
be but the expression of its feelings! What if these dying,
melancholy cadences, which so melt and sink into the
heart, be&mdash;what we may so naturally interpret them&mdash;the
melodious sinkings of a deep-seated and hopeless unhappiness!
Nay, the fancy is too wild for even a dream. But
are there none of those fine analogies, which run through
the whole of nature and the whole of art, to sublime it
into truth? Yes, <em>there have</em> been such living harps among
us; beings, the tones of whose sentiments, the melody of
whose emotions, the cadences of whose sorrows, remain to
thrill, and delight, and humanize our souls. They seem
born for others, not for themselves. Alas, for the hapless
companion of my early youth! Alas, for him, the pride
of his country, the friend of my maturer manhood!&mdash;But
my narrative lags in its progress.</p>

<p>My vessel lay in the Clyde for several weeks during the
summer of 1794, and I found time to indulge myself in a
brief tour along the western coasts of the kingdom, from
Glasgow to the Borders. I entered Dumfries in a calm,
lovely evening, and passed along one of the principal streets.
The shadows of the houses on the western side were
stretched half-way across the pavement, while, on the side
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
opposite, the bright sunshine seemed sleeping on the jutting
irregular fronts, and high antique gables. There seemed a
world of well-dressed company this evening in town; and I
learned, on inquiry, that all the aristocracy of the adjacent
country, for twenty miles round, had come in to attend a
county ball. They went fluttering along the sunny side of
the street, gay as butterflies&mdash;group succeeding group.
On the opposite side, in the shade, a solitary individual
was passing slowly along the pavement. I knew him at a
glance. It was the first poet, perhaps the greatest man, of
his age and country. But why so solitary? It had been
told me that he ranked among his friends and associates
many of the highest names in the kingdom, and yet to-night
not one of the hundreds who fluttered past appeared
inclined to recognise him. He seemed too&mdash;but perhaps
fancy misled me&mdash;as if care-worn and dejected; pained,
perhaps, that not one among so many of the <em>great</em> should
have humility enough to notice a poor exciseman. I stole
up to him unobserved, and tapped him on the shoulder;
there was a decided fierceness in his manner as he turned
abruptly round, but, as he recognised me, his expressive
countenance lighted up in a moment, and I shall never
forget the heartiness with which he grasped my hand.</p>

<p>We quitted the streets together for the neighbouring
fields, and, after the natural interchange of mutual
congratulations&mdash;&ldquo;How is it,&rdquo; I inquired, &ldquo;that you do not
seem to have a single acquaintance among all the gay and
great of the country?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I lie under quarantine,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;tainted by the
plague of liberalism. There is not one of the hundreds we
passed to-night whom I could not once reckon among my
intimates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The intelligence stunned and irritated me.
&ldquo;How infinitely absurd!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Do they dream of sinking you
into a common man?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
&ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; he rejoined. &ldquo;Do they not all know I have
been a gauger for the last five years!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fact had both grieved and incensed me long before.
I knew, too, that Pye enjoyed his salary as poet laureate of
the time, and Dibdin, the song writer, his pension of two
hundred a-year, and I blushed for my country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he continued&mdash;the ill-assumed coolness of his
manner giving way before his highly excited feelings&mdash;&ldquo;they
have assigned me my place among the mean and the
degraded, as their best patronage; and only yesterday, after
an official threat of instant dismission, I was told it was
my business to act, not to think. God help me! what
have I done to provoke such bitter insult? I have ever
discharged my miserable duty&mdash;discharged it, Mr. Lindsay,
however repugnant to my feelings, as an honest man; and
though there awaited me no promotion, I was silent. The
wives or sisters of those whom they advanced over me had
bastards to some of the&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;family, and so their influence
was necessarily greater than mine. But now they crush
me into the very dust. I take an interest in the struggles
of the slave for his freedom; I express my opinions as if I
myself were a free man; and they threaten to starve me
and my children if I dare so much as speak or think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I expressed my indignant sympathy in a few broken
sentences; and he went on with kindling animation:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they would fain crush me into the very dust!
They cannot forgive me, that, being born a man, I should
walk erect according to my nature. Mean-spirited and
despicable themselves, they can tolerate only the mean-spirited
and the despicable; and were I not so entirely in
their power, Mr. Lindsay, I could regard them with the
proper contempt. But the wretches can starve me and my
children&mdash;and they <em>know</em> it; nor does it mend the matter
that I <em>know</em> in turn, what pitiful, miserable, little creatures
they are. What care I for the butterflies of to-night?&mdash;they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
passed me without the honour of their notice; and I,
in turn, suffered them to pass without the honour of mine;
and I am more than quits. Do I not know that they and
I are going on to the fulfilment of our several destinies?&mdash;they
to sleep, in the obscurity of their native insignificance,
with the pismires and grasshoppers of all the past, and I to
be whatever the millions of my unborn countrymen shall
yet decide. Pitiful little insects of an hour! what is their
notice to me! But I bear a heart, Mr. Lindsay, that can
feel the pain of treatment so unworthy; and I must confess
it moves me. One cannot always live upon the future,
divorced from the sympathies of the present. One cannot
always solace one&#8217;s self under the grinding despotism that
would fetter one&#8217;s very thoughts, with the conviction, however
assured, that posterity will do justice both to the
oppressor and the oppressed. I am sick at heart; and
were it not for the poor little things that depend so entirely
on my exertions, I could as cheerfully lay me down in the
grave as I ever did in bed after the fatigues of a long day&#8217;s
labour. Heaven help me! I am miserably unfitted to
struggle with even the natural evils of existence&mdash;how
much more so when these are multiplied and exaggerated
by the proud, capricious inhumanity of man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a miserable lack of right principle and right
feeling,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;among our upper classes in the present
day; but, alas for poor human nature! it has ever been
so, and, I am afraid, ever will. And there is quite as much
of it in savage as in civilized life. I have seen the exclusive
aristocratic spirit, with its one-sided injustice, as rampant
in a wild isle of the Pacific as I ever saw it among ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8217;Tis slight comfort,&rdquo; said my friend, with a melancholy
smile, &ldquo;to be assured, when one&#8217;s heart bleeds from the
cruelty or injustice of our fellows, that man is naturally
cruel and unjust, and not less so as a savage than when
better taught. I knew you, Mr. Lindsay, when you were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
younger and less fortunate; but you have now reached
that middle term of life when man naturally takes up the
Tory and lays down the Whig; nor has there been aught
in your improving circumstances to retard the change;
and so you rest in the conclusion that, if the weak among
us suffer from the tyranny of the strong, &#8217;tis because human
nature is so constituted, and the case therefore cannot be
helped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Mr. Burns,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I am not quite so
finished a Tory as that amounts to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not one of those fanciful declaimers,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;who set out on the assumption that man is free-born.
I am too well assured of the contrary. Man is not
free-born. The earlier period of his existence, whether as
a puny child or the miserable denizen of an uninformed
and barbarous state, is one of vassalage and subserviency.
He is not born free, he is not born rational, he is not born
virtuous; he is born to <em>become</em> all these. And woe to the
sophist who, with arguments drawn from the unconfirmed
constitution of his childhood, would strive to render his
imperfect, because immature, state of pupilage a permanent
one! We are yet far below the level of which our
nature is capable, and possess in consequence but a small
portion of the liberty which it is the destiny of our species
to enjoy. And &#8217;tis time our masters should be taught so.
You will deem me a wild Jacobin, Mr. Lindsay; but persecution
has the effect of making a man extreme in these
matters. Do help me to curse the scoundrels!&mdash;my business
to act, not to think!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were silent for several minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not yet thanked you, Mr. Burns,&rdquo; I at length
said, &ldquo;for the most exquisite pleasure I ever enjoyed. You
have been my companion for the last eight years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His countenance brightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, here I am boring you with my miseries and my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
ill-nature,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but you must come along with
me and see the bairns and Jean; and some of the best
songs I ever wrote. It will go hard if we hold not care at
the staff&#8217;s end for at least one evening. You have not yet
seen my stone punch-bowl, nor my Tam o&#8217;Shanter, nor a
hundred other fine things beside. And yet, vile wretch
that I am, I am sometimes so unconscionable as to be
unhappy with them all. But come along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We spent this evening together with as much of happiness
as it has ever been my lot to enjoy. Never was there
a fonder father than Burns, a more attached husband, or a
warmer friend. There was an exuberance of love in his
large heart, that encircled in its flow, relatives, friends,
associates, his country, the world; and, in his kinder
moods, the sympathetic influence which he exerted over
the hearts of others seemed magical. I laughed and cried
this evening by turns; I was conscious of a wider and
warmer expansion of feeling than I had ever experienced
before; my very imagination seemed invigorated by
breathing, as it were, in the same atmosphere with his.
We parted early next morning&mdash;and when I again visited
Dumfries, I went and wept over his grave. Forty years
have now passed since his death, and in that time many
poets have arisen to achieve a rapid and brilliant celebrity;
but they seem the meteors of a lower sky; the flush passes
hastily from the expanse, and we see but one great light
looking steadily upon us from above. It is Burns who is
exclusively the poet of his country. Other writers inscribe
their names on the plaster which covers for the time the
outside structure of society; his is engraved, like that of
the Egyptian architect, on the ever-during granite within.
The fame of the others rises and falls with the uncertain
undulations of the mode on which they have reared it;
his remains fixed and permanent, as the human nature on
which it is based. Or, to borrow the figures Johnson
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
employs in illustrating the unfluctuating celebrity of a
scarcely greater poet&mdash;&ldquo;The sand heaped by one flood is
scattered by another, but the rock always continues in its
place. The stream of time, which is continually washing
the dissoluble fabrics of other poets, passes, without injury,
by the adamant of Shakspeare.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE PROFESSOR&#8217;S TALES.</h2>

<h3>THE CONVIVIALISTS.</h3>


<p>We must introduce our readers, with an apology for our
abruptness, into a party of about half-a-dozen young gallants,
who had evidently been making deep and frequent
libations at the shrine of Bacchus. The loud bursts of
hearty laughter which rang round the room like so many
triple bobmajors, the leering eyes, the familiar diminutives
with which the various parties addressed each other, and
the frequent locking of hands together in a grasp the
force of which was meant to express an ardour of social
friendship which words were too weak to convey&mdash;all
showed that the symposiasts had cleared the fences which
prudence or selfishness set up in the sober intercourse of
life, and were now, with loosened reins, spurring away
over the free wild fields of fancy and fun. An immense
quantity of walnut-shells&mdash;which the mercurial compotators
had been amusing themselves by throwing at each
other&mdash;lay scattered about the table and on the floor; two
or three shivered wine glasses had been shoved into the
centre of the table, the fragments glittering upon a pile of
glorious Woodvilles, all speckled over, like Jacob&#8217;s sheep;
each man had one of the weeds stuck rakishly in the corner of
his mouth, and was knocking off the ashes upon his deviled
biscuits; and, to the right of the president&#8217;s chair, a long
straggling regiment of empty bottles gave dumb but eloquent
proof of the bibulous capabilities of the company.
Each man was talking vehemently to his neighbour, and
every one for himself; in order, as a wag among them said,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
to get through the work quickly, and jump at once to a
conclusion. They were, as Sheridan has it, &ldquo;arguing in
platoons.&rdquo; There was one exception, however, to the
boisterous mirth of the convivialists, in the person of
Frank Elliot, in celebration of whose obtaining his medical
degree the feast had been given. He was leaning back in
his chair, gazing, with a slight curl of contempt on his lip,
at the rude glee of his associates. He had distinguished
himself so highly among his fellow-students, that one of
the professors had, in the ceremony of the morning, singled
him out, before all his contemporaries, with the highest
eulogiums, and had predicted, in the most flattering manner,
his certain celebrity in his profession. Perhaps the
natural vanity which these public honours had created,
the bright prospect which lay before him, and his being
less excited than his companions&mdash;caused him to turn,
with disgust, from the silly ribaldry and weak witticisms
which circled round his table. Amid the uproar his
silence was for some time unheeded; but at length Harry
Whitaker, his old college chum, now lieutenant in his
Majesty&#8217;s navy, and with a considerable portion of broad
sailor&#8217;s humour and slang, observed it, and slapping him
roundly on the back, cried, &ldquo;Hilloa, Frank! what are you
dodging about?&mdash;quizzing the rig of your convoy, because
they have too much light duck set to walk steadily through
the water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frank! why, isn&#8217;t he asleep all this time? I haven&#8217;t
heard his voice this half hour,&rdquo; exclaimed another.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
&ldquo;&lsquo;Parce meum, quisquis tanges cava marmora somnum<br />
  <span style="margin-left: .5em;">Rumpere; sive bibas, sive lavere, tace,&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>said Elliot beseechingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;none of your heathenish
lingo over the mahogany. Boys! I move that Frank be
made to swallow a tumbler of port for using bad language,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
and to make him fit company for the rest of us honest
fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Fiat experimentum in corpore vili</em>,&rdquo; squeaked a first year
medical student, shoving the lighted end of his cigar, by
mistake, into his mouth when he had delivered his sentence,
and then springing up and sputtering out a mighty
oath and a quantity of hot tobacco ashes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ashes to ashes,&rdquo; cried Harry, filling up a tumbler to
the brim; &ldquo;we&#8217;ll let you off this time, as you&#8217;re a fire-eater;
but rally round, lads, and see this land shark swallow
his grog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, but, my friends&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;began Frank, seeing, with
horror, that the party had gathered round him, and that
Harry held the glass inexorably in his mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get a gag rigged,&rdquo; shouted the young sailor; &ldquo;we&#8217;ll
find a way into his grog shop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, Whitaker,&rdquo; said Frank, with a ludicrous
intonation of voice, between real anger and distress,
&ldquo;this is too hard on one who has filled fairly from the
first&mdash;to punish him without an inquiry into the justice of
the case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jeddart justice&mdash;hang first, and judge after!&rdquo; roared a
student from the sylvan banks of the Jed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No freeman can, under any pretence,&rdquo; hiccupped a
young advocate, who was unable to rise from his chair,
&ldquo;be condemned, except by the legal decision of his peers,
or by the law of the land. So sayeth the Magna Charta&mdash;King
John&mdash;(<em>hic</em>)&mdash;right of all free-born Englishmen&mdash;including
thereby all inhabitants of Great Britain, incorporated
at the Union&mdash;<em>hic</em>&mdash;and Ireland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whitaker set the tumbler down in despair, finding that
his companions, like the generality of raw students, were
so completely wedded to their pedantry, that the fine, if
insisted on, would have to go all round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&#8217;s have a song, Rhimeson,&rdquo; cried Frank, very glad
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
to escape from his threatened bumper, and still fearful that
it might be insisted upon, &ldquo;a song extempore, as becomes
a poet in his cups, and in thine own vein; for what says
Spenser?&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&lsquo;For Bacchus&#8217; fruit is friend to Ph&oelig;bus wise;</span><br />
 And when, with wine, the brain begins to sweat,<br />
 The numbers flow as fast as spring doth rise.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove, boys! you shall have it,&rdquo; cried Rhimeson,
filling his glass with unsteady hand, and muttering, from
the same prince of poets&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
&ldquo;&lsquo;Who can counsell a thirstie soule,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: .5em;">With patience to forbeare the offred bowle?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the pure well of English undefiled, old fellows,
and so here goes&mdash;&lsquo;The Lass we Love!&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 13em;">
  <span class="smcap">Tune</span>&mdash;&lsquo;<em>Duncan Davison.</em>&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Come, fill your glass, my trusty friend,</span><br />
 And fill it sparkling to the brim&mdash;<br />
 A flowing bumper, bright and strong&mdash;<br />
 And push the bottle back again;<br />
 For what is man without his drink?<br />
 An oyster prison&#8217;d in his shell;<br />
 A rushlight in the vaults of death;<br />
 A rattlesnake without his tail.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 17em;">
            <span class="smcap">chorus</span>.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
    This world, we know, is full of cares,<br />
    And sorrow darkens every day;<br />
    But wine and love shall be the stars<br />
    To light us on our weary way.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
 Beyond yon hills there lives a lass,<br />
 Her name I dare not even speak;<br />
 The wine that sparkles in my glass<br />
 Was ne&#8217;er so rosy as her cheek.<br />
 Her neck is clearer than the spring<br />
 That streams the water lilies on;<br />
 So, here&#8217;s to her I long have loved&mdash;<br />
 The fairest flower in Albion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
 Let knaves and fools this world divide,<br />
 As they have done since Adam&#8217;s time;<br />
 Let misers by their hoards abide,<br />
 And poets weave their rotten rhyme;<br />
 But ye, who, in an hour like this,<br />
 Feel every pulse to rapture move,<br />
 Fill high! each lip the goblet kiss&mdash;<br />
 The pledge shall be&mdash;&lsquo;The Lass we Love!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a good deal of roaritorious applause, the young
gentlemen began to act upon the hint contained in the
song, and each to give, as a toast, the lady of his heart.
When it came to Elliot&#8217;s turn, he declared he was unable
to fulfil the conditions of the toast, as there was not a
woman in the world for whom he had the slightest
predilection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, thou personified snowball! thou human icicle!&rdquo;
cried Whitaker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say an avalanche,&rdquo; interrupted Frank; &ldquo;for, when
once my heart is shaken, it will be as irresistible in its
course as one of these &lsquo;thunderbolts of snow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still, it&#8217;s nothing but cold snow, for all that,&rdquo; cried
Harry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who talks of Frank Elliot and love in the same breath?&rdquo;
cried Rhimeson; &ldquo;why, his heart is like a rock,
and love, like a torpid serpent, enclosed in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied Frank; &ldquo;but, you know, these same
serpents sting as hard as ever when once they get into the
open air; besides, love, as the shepherd in Virgil discovered,
is an inhabitant of the rocks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound the fellow! he&#8217;s a walking apothegm&mdash;as
consequential as a syllogism!&rdquo; muttered Harry; &ldquo;but
come now, Frank, let us have the inexpressive she, without
backing and filling any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, Harry, it is out of my power; but, in a
few weeks, I hope to&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;said Elliot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope, Frank, hope, my good fellow, is a courtier very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
pleasant and agreeable in his conversation, but very much
given to forget his promises. But I&#8217;ll tell you, Frank,
since you won&#8217;t give a toast, I will, because I know it will
punish you&mdash;so, gentlemen&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The toast was only suited for the meridian of the place
in which it was given, and we will, therefore, be excused
from repeating it. But Whitaker had judged rightly that
he had punished his friend, who, from the strictness of his
education, and a certain delicacy in his opinions respecting
women, could never tolerate the desecration of these
opinions by the libertine ribaldry which forms so great a
part of the conversation of many men after the first bottle.
Frank&#8217;s brow darkened, his keen eye turned with a glance
of indignation to Harry; and he was prevented only by
the circumstance of being in his own house, from instantly
kicking him out of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at Frank now, gentles,&rdquo; continued the young
sailor, when the mirth had subsided; &ldquo;his face is as long
as a ropewalk, while every one of yours is as broad as the
main hatchway. He has a reverence for women as great
as I have for my own tight, clean, sprightly craft; but
because a fellow kicks one of my loose spars, or puts it to
a base use, I&#8217;m not to quarrel with him, as if he had called
my vessel a collier, eh? Frank, my good fellow, you&#8217;re
too sober; you&#8217;re thinking too much of yourself; you&#8217;re
looking at the world with convex glasses; and thus the
world seems little&mdash;you yourself only great; but, recollect,
everybody looks through a convex glass; and that&#8217;s vanity,
Frank:&mdash;there, now! the murder&#8217;s out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Harry,&rdquo; cried Rhimeson, good-naturedly; for he
saw Elliot&#8217;s nether lip grow white with suppressed passion;
&ldquo;don&#8217;t push Frank too hard, for charity&#8217;s sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charity, to be sure!&rdquo; interrupted Harry; &ldquo;but consider
what I must have suffered if I had not got that dead
weight pitched overboard. I was labouring in the trough,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
man, and would have foundered with that spite in my
hold. Charity begins at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8217;Tis a pity that the charity of many persons ends there too,&rdquo;
said Frank drily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frank&#8217;s wit is like the King of Prussia&#8217;s regiment of death,&rdquo;
said the young seaman&mdash;&ldquo;it gives no quarter. But come now, my
lads, rig me out a female craft fit for that snow-blooded
youngster to go captain of in the voyage of matrimony; do it
shipshape, and bear a hand. I would try it myself; but the room
looks, to my eyes, as it were filled with dancing logarithms;
and then he&#8217;s so cold, slow, misty-hearted&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That if,&rdquo; cried Rhimeson, interrupting him, &ldquo;he addresses
a lady as cold, slow, and misty-hearted as himself,
they may go on courting the whole course of their natural
lives, like the assymptotes of a hyperbola, which approach
nearer and nearer, <em>ad infinitum</em>, without the possibility of
ever meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&mdash;ay,&rdquo; shouted Harry; &ldquo;and if he addresses
one of a sanguine temperament, there will be a
pretty considerable traffic of quarrels carried on between
them, typified and illustrated very well by the constant
commerce of heat which is maintained between the poles
and the equator, by the agency of opposite currents in the
atmosphere. By Jove! Frank, matrimony presents the
fire of two batteries at you; one rakes you fore and aft,
and the other strikes between wind and water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And pray, Harry, what sort of a consort will you sail
with yourself?&rdquo; inquired Rhimeson. This was, perhaps,
a question, of all others, that the young sailor would have
wished to avoid answering at that time. He was the
accepted lover of the sister of his friend Elliot&mdash;and, at
the moment he was running Frank down, to be, as he
himself might have said, brought up standing, was sufficiently
disagreeable.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
&ldquo;Come, come, Harry,&rdquo; cried the young poet, seeing the
sailor hesitate; &ldquo;let&#8217;s have her from skysail-mast fid to
keel&mdash;from starboard to larboard stunsails&mdash;from the tip
of the flying, jib-boom to the taffrail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&#8217;re all fireships, Rhimeson!&rdquo; replied Harry, with
forced gaiety&mdash;for he was indignant at Elliot&#8217;s keen and
suspicious glance&mdash;&ldquo;and, if I do come near them, it shall
always be to windward, for the Christian purpose of blowing
them out of the water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A libertine,&rdquo; said Frank, significantly, &ldquo;reviles women
just in the same way that licentious priests lay the blame
of the disrespect with which parsons are treated on the
irreligion of the laity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t understand either your wit or your manner,
Frank,&rdquo; replied Harry, giving a lurch in his chair; &ldquo;but
this I know, that I don&#8217;t care a handful of shakings for
either of them; and I say still, that women are all fireships&mdash;keep
to windward of them&mdash;pretty things to try
your young gunners at; but, if you close with them,
you&#8217;re gone, that&#8217;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll tell you what you&#8217;re very like, just now, Harry,&rdquo;
said Frank&mdash;who had been pouring down glass after glass
of wine, as if to quench his anger&mdash;&ldquo;you&#8217;re just like a
turkey cock after his head has been cut off, which will
keep stalking on in the same gait for several yards before
he drops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elliot! do you mean to insult me?&rdquo; cried Whitaker,
springing furiously from his seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I leave that to the decision of your own incomparable
judgment, sir,&rdquo; replied Elliot, bowing, with a sneer just
visible on his features.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I thought so, Frank, I would&mdash;&mdash;but it&#8217;s impossible;
you are my oldest friend.&rdquo; And the young sailor sat down
with a moody brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you, sir?&rdquo; said Elliot, in a tone of calm
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
contempt; &ldquo;bear it meekly, I presume? Nay, do not look
big, and clench your hands, sir, unless, like Bob Acres,
you feel your valour oozing out at your palms, and are
striving to retain it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll tell you what, Elliot,&rdquo; cried the young sailor, again
springing to his feet, and seizing a decanter of wine by the
neck, &ldquo;I don&#8217;t know what prevents me from driving this
at your head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be quite in keeping with the rest of your
gentlemanly conduct, sir,&rdquo; replied Frank, still keeping his
seat, and looking at Harry with the most cool and provoking
derision; &ldquo;but I&#8217;ll tell you why you don&#8217;t&mdash;you dare not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that you are Harriet Elliot&#8217;s brother&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;began
Harry, furiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scoundrel!&rdquo; thundered Elliot, rising suddenly, and
making a stride towards the young sailor, while the veins
of his brow protruded like lines of cordage; &ldquo;utter that
name again, before me, with these blasphemous lips&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Elliot had scarce, however, let fall the opprobrious
epithet, ere the decanter flew, with furious force, from
Whitaker&#8217;s hand, and, narrowly missing Frank&#8217;s head, was
shivered on the wall beyond.</p>

<p>In a moment the young sailor was in the nervous grasp
of Frank, who, apparently without the slightest exertion
of his vast strength, lifted up the comparatively slight form
of Whitaker, and laid him on his back on the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be grateful, sir,&rdquo; said he, pressing the prostrate youth
firmly down with one hand; &ldquo;be grateful to the laws of
hospitality, which, though you may think it a slight matter
to violate, prevent me from striking you in my own house,
or pitching you out of the window. Rise, sir, and begone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry rose slowly; and it was almost fearful to see the
change which passion had wrought in a few moments on
his features. The red flush of drunken rage was entirely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
gone, and the livid cheek, the pale quivering lip, and collected
eye, which had usurped its place, showed that the
degradation he had just undergone had completely sobered
him, and given his passion a new but more malignant
character. He stood for a brief period in moody silence,
whilst the rest of the young men closed round him and
Frank, with the intention of reconciling them. At length
he moved away towards the door, pushing his friends rudely
aside; but turning, before he left the room, he said, in a
voice trembling with suppressed emotion&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope to meet Mr. Elliot where his mere brute strength
will be laid aside for more honourable and equitable weapons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be happy, at any place or time, to show my
sense of Mr. Whitaker&#8217;s late courtesy,&rdquo; replied Frank, bowing
slightly, and then drawing up his magnificent figure
to its utmost height.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it be <em>now</em>, then, sir,&rdquo; said the young sailor, stepping
back into the centre of the room, and pointing to a
brace of sharps, which, among foils and masks, hung on
one of the walls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no!&mdash;for God&#8217;s sake, not now!&rdquo; burst from
every one except Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can neither be now nor here, sir,&rdquo; replied he, firmly,
motioning Whitaker haughtily to the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Harry, turning round to his friends
with a loud laugh of derision, &ldquo;you see that vanity is
stronger than valour. Pompey&#8217;s troops were beaten at the
battle of Pharsalia, only because they were afraid of their
pretty faces. Upon my soul, I believe Mr. Elliot&#8217;s handsome
features stand in the way of his gallantry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Begone, trifler!&rdquo; cried Frank, relapsing into fury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coward!&rdquo; shouted the young sailor at the top of his
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; exclaimed Elliot, starting, as if an adder had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
stung him; then, with a convulsive effort controlling his
rage, he took down the swords, threw one of them upon
the table, and putting his arm into Rhimeson&#8217;s, beckoned
the young sailor to follow him, and left the apartment.
As it was in vain that the remainder of the young men
attempted to restrain Whitaker, they agreed to accompany
him in a body, in order, if possible, to prevent mischief;
all but the young advocate whom we have before mentioned,
who, having too great a respect for the law to
patronise other methods of redressing grievances, ran off
to secure the assistance of the city authorities.</p>

<p>The moon, which had been wading among thick masses
of clouds, emerged into the clear blue sky, and scattered
her silver showers of light on the rocks and green sides of
Arthur&#8217;s Seat, as the young men reached a secluded part
in the valley at its foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gracious Heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed the young poet to Frank,
as they turned to wait for Whitaker and his companions,
&ldquo;how horrible it is to desecrate a scene and hour like this
by violence&mdash;perhaps, Elliot, by <em>murder</em>!&rdquo; Frank did not
reply; his thoughts were at that time with his aged mother
and his now unprotected sister; and he bitterly reflected
that to whoever of them, in the approaching contest,
wounds or death might fall, poor Harriet would have
equally to suffer. But the young sailor, still boiling with
rage, at that moment approached, and throwing his cloak
on a rock, cried, &ldquo;Now, sir!&rdquo; and placed himself in attitude.</p>

<p>Their swords crossed, and, for a brief space, nothing was
heard but the hard breathing of the spectators and the
clashing of the steel, as the well-practised combatants
parried each other&#8217;s thrusts. Elliot was, incomparably, the
cooler of the two, and he threw away many chances in
which his adversary placed himself open to a palpable hit,
his aim being to disarm his antagonist without wounding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
him. An unforeseen accident prevented this. Whitaker,
pressing furiously forward, struck his foot against a stone,
and falling, received Elliot&#8217;s sword in his body, the hilt,
striking with a deep, quick, sullen sound against his breast.
The young sailor fell with a sharp aspiration of anguish;
and his victorious adversary, horrified by the sight, and
rendered silent by the sudden revulsion of his feelings,
stood, for some time, gazing at his sword, from the point
of which the blood drops trickled slowly, and fell on the
dewy sward. &ldquo;&#8217;Tis the blood of my dearest, oldest friend&mdash;of
my brother; and shed by my hand!&rdquo; he muttered at
length, flinging away the guilty blade. His only answer
was the groans of his victim, and the shrill whistle of the
weapon as it flew through the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harry, my friend, my brother!&rdquo; cried the young man,
in a tone of unutterable anguish, kneeling down on the
grass, and pressing the already cold clammy hand of his
late foe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your voice is pleasant to me, Frank, even in death,&rdquo;
muttered the young sailor, in a thick obstructed voice.
&ldquo;I have done you wrong&mdash;forgive me while I can hear
you; and tell Harriet&mdash;oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, I do forgive you; but, oh! how shall I forgive
myself? Speak to me, Harry!&rdquo; And Elliot, frantic at the
sight of the bloody motionless heap before him, repeated
the name of his friend till his voice rose into a scream of
agony that curdled the very blood of his friends, and
re-echoed among the rocks above, like the voices of tortured
demons. Affairs were in this situation when the
young advocate came running breathless up to them, and
saw, at a glance, that he was too late. &ldquo;Fly, for Heaven&#8217;s
sake! fly, Elliot; here is money; you may need it,&rdquo; he
cried; &ldquo;the officers will be here instantly, and your existence
may be the forfeit of this unhappy chance. Fly!
every moment lost is a stab at your life!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
&ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; replied the wretched young man, rising and
gazing with folded arms down upon his victim; &ldquo;what
have I to do with life?&mdash;<em>he</em> has ceased to live. I will not
leave him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His friends joined in urging Elliot to instant flight; but
he only pointed to the body, and said, in the low tones of
calm despair: &ldquo;Do you think I can leave him now, and
thus? Let those fly who are in love with life; I shall
remain and meet my fate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frank Elliot!&rdquo; muttered the wounded man, reviving
from the fainting fit into which he had fallen; &ldquo;come near
to me, for I am very weak, and swear to grant the request
I have to make, as you would have my last moments free
from the bitterest agony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elliot flung himself on the ground by the side of his
friend, and, in a voice broken by anguish, swore to attend
to his words. &ldquo;Then leave this spot immediately,&rdquo; said
the young sailor, speaking slowly and with extreme difficulty;
&ldquo;and should this be my last request&mdash;as I feel it
must be&mdash;get out of the country till the present unhappy
affair is forgotten; and moreover, mark, Frank&mdash;and, my
friends, attend to my words:&mdash;I entreat, I <em>command</em> you to
lay the entire blame of this quarrel and its consequences
on me. One of you will write to my poor father, and say
it was my last request that he should consider Elliot innocent,
and that I give my dying curse to any one who shall
attempt to revenge my death. Ah! that was a pang! How
dim your faces look in the moonlight! Your hand, dearest
Frank, once more; and now away! Keep this, I charge
you, from my Harriet&mdash;<em>my</em> Harriet! O God!&rdquo; And, with
a shudder, that shook visibly his whole frame, the unfortunate
youth relapsed into insensibility. There was a
brief pause, during which the feelings of the spectators
may be better imagined than described, though, assuredly,
admiration of the generous anxiety of the young sailor to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
do justice to his friend was the prevailing sentiment of
their minds. At length the stifled sound of voices, and
the dimly seen forms of two or three men stealing towards
them, within the shadow of the mountain, roused them
from their reverie; and Rhimeson, who had not till now
spoken, entreated Elliot to obey the dying request of his
friend, and fly before the police reached them. &ldquo;I have
not before urged you to this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;lest you should
think it was from a selfish motive; for, as your second, I
am equally implicated with you in this unhappy affair; but
<em>now</em>,&rdquo; continued he, with melancholy emphasis, &ldquo;there
is nothing to be gained and everything to be hazarded by
remaining.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The generous argument of the poet at length overcame
Elliot&#8217;s resolution; he bent down quickly and kissed the
cold lips of his friend, then waving a silent adieu to the
others, he quitted the melancholy scene. The police&mdash;for
it proved to be they&mdash;were within a hundred yards of the
spot when the young men left the rest of the group, and,
instantly emerging from the shadow which had till now
partially concealed them, the leader of the party directed
one of his attendants to remain with the body, and set off,
with two or three others, in pursuit of the fugitives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; cried Rhimeson, when he saw this movement
of the pursuers; and springing as he spoke towards
the entrance of a narrow defile which lay entirely in the
shadow of the mountain. A deep convulsive sob burst
from the pent-up bosom of Elliot ere he replied: &ldquo;Leave
me to my fate, my friend; I cannot fly; the weight of his
blood crushes me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is childish, unjust,&rdquo; said Rhimeson, with strong
emotion; &ldquo;but once more, Frank, will you control this
weakness and follow me, or will you slight the last wish of
one friend, and sacrifice another, by remaining? for without
you I will not stir. Now, choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
&ldquo;Lead on,&rdquo; said Elliot, rousing himself with a convulsive
effort; and, striking into the gloom, the two young men
sped forward with a step as fleet as that of the hunted deer.</p>

<p>Their pursuers having seen them stand, had slackened
their pace, or it is probable the fugitives would have been
captured before Rhimeson had prevailed on his friend to
fly; but now, separating so as to intercept them if they
deviated from the direct path, the policemen raised a loud
shout and instantly gave chase. But the young poet, in his
solitary rambles amid the noble scenery of Arthur&#8217;s Seat
and the adjoining valleys, had become intimately acquainted
with every path which led through their romantic recesses;
and he now sped along the broken footway which
skirted the mountain-side with as much confidence as if
he had trod on a level sward in the light of noonday.
Elliot, having his mind diverted by the necessity of looking
to his immediate preservation&mdash;for the path, strewed
with fragments of rock, led along what might well be
termed a precipice, of two or three hundred feet in height&mdash;roused
up all his energies, and followed his friend with
a speed which speedily left their pursuers far behind. Thus
they held on for about a quarter of an hour, gradually
and obliquely ascending the mountain side, until the voices
of the policemen, calling to each other far down in the
valley, proved that they had escaped the immediate danger
which had threatened them. Still, however, Rhimeson
kept on, though he relaxed his pace in order to hold some
communication with his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have distanced the bloodhounds for the nonce,
Frank,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;these ale-swilling rascals cannot set a
stout heart to a stey brae; but whither shall we go now?
Edinburgh, perhaps Scotland, is too hot to hold us, and
the point is how to get out of it. What do you advise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am utterly careless about it, Rhimeson; do as you
think best,&rdquo; replied Elliot, in a tone of deep despondency.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
&ldquo;Cheer up, cheer up! my dear Frank,&rdquo; said the young
poet, feigning a confidence of hope which his heart belied.
&ldquo;Whitaker may still recover; he is too gallant a fellow
to be lost to us in a drunken brawl; and even if the worst
should happen, it must still keep you from despair to
reflect that you were forced into this rencontre, and that it
was an unhappy accident, resulting from his own violence
and not your intention, which deprived him of his life.&rdquo;
Elliot stopped suddenly, and gazing down from the height
which they had now reached into the valley, seemed to be
searching for the spot where the fatal accident had taken
place, as if to assist him in the train of thought which his
friend&#8217;s words had aroused. The dark group of human
beings were seen dimly in the moonlight, moving with a
slow pace along the hollow of the gorge towards the city,
bearing along with them the body of the young sailor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear Frank,&rdquo; said Rhimeson, deeply commiserating
the anguish which developed itself in the clasped uplifted
hands and shuddering frame of his unhappy friend,
&ldquo;bear up against this cruel accident like a man&mdash;he may
still recover.&rdquo; Elliot moved away from the ridge which
overlooked the valley, muttering, as if unconsciously&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
              <span style="margin-left: 5em;">&ldquo;&lsquo;Action is momentary&mdash;</span><br />
The motion of a muscle this way or that;<br />
Suffering is long, obscure, and infinite!&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<p>How profound and awful is that sentiment!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sound of a piece of rock dislodged from the mountain
side, and thundering and crashing down the steep,
awakened Rhimeson from his contemplation of Elliot&#8217;s
grief; and, springing again to the brink of the almost
precipitous descent, he saw that one of their pursuers had
crept up by the inequalities of the rock, and was within
a few yards of the summit.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
&ldquo;Dog!&rdquo; cried the young man, heaving off a fragment of
rock, and in the act of dashing it down upon the unprotected
head of the policeman, &ldquo;offer to stir, and I will
scatter your brains upon the cliffs!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A shrill cry of terror burst from the poor fellow&#8217;s lips as
he gazed upwards at the frightful attitude of his enemy,
and expected every moment to see the dreadful engine
hurled at his head. The cry was answered by the shouts
of his companions, who, by different paths, had arrived
within a short distance of the fugitives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Retire miscreant! or I will send your mangled carcass
down to the foot without your help,&rdquo; shouted Rhimeson,
swinging the huge stone up to the extent of his arms. His
answer was a pistol shot, which, whistling past his cheek,
struck the uplifted fragment of rock with such force as to
send a stunning feeling up to his very shoulders. The
stone fell from his benumbed grasp, and, striking the edge
of the cliff, bounded innocuous over the head of the
policeman, who, springing upwards, was within a few feet
of Rhimeson before he had fully recovered himself.
&ldquo;Away!&rdquo; he cried, taking again the path up the mountain,
and closely followed by Elliot, who, during the few
moments in which the foregoing scene was being enacted,
had remained almost motionless&mdash;&ldquo;Away! give them a
flying shot at least,&rdquo; continued he, feeling all the romance
of his nature aroused by the circumstances in which he
was placed. The policeman, however, who had only fired
in self-defence, refrained from using his other pistol, now
that the danger was past; but grasping it firmly in his
hand, he followed the steps of the young men with a speed
stimulated by the desire of revenge, and a kind of professional
eagerness to capture so daring an offender. But,
in spite of his exertions, the superior agility of the fugitives
gradually widened the distance between them; and at
length, as they emerged from the rocky ground upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
smooth short grass, where a footfall could not be heard,
the moon became again obscured by dark clouds, and
Rhimeson, whispering his companion to observe his
motions, turned short off the path they had been following,
and struck eastward among the green hills towards the
sea. They could hear the curse of the policeman, and the
click of his pistol lock, as if he had intended to send a
leaden messenger into the darkness in search of them.
But the expected report did not follow; and, favoured by
the continued obscurity of the night, they were, in a short
time, descending the hill behind Duddingstone, which lies
at the opposite extremity of the King&#8217;s Park. Still continuing
their route eastward, they walked forward at a
rapid pace, consulting on their future movements. The
sound of wheels rapidly approaching, interrupted their
conversation. It was the south mail.</p>

<p>In a short time they were flying through the country
towards Newcastle, at the rate of ten miles an hour,
including stoppages. Elliot was at the river side, searching
for a vessel to convey them to some part of the continent,
and Rhimeson was dozing over a newspaper in the
Turk&#8217;s Head in that town, when a policeman entered, and,
mistaking him for Elliot, took him into custody. How
their route had been discovered, Rhimeson knew not; but
he was possessed of sufficient presence of mind to personate
his friend, and offer to accompany the police officer instantly
back to Edinburgh, leaving a letter and a considerable
sum of money for Elliot. In a few minutes, the
generous fellow leaped into the post-chaise, with a heart
as light as many a bridegroom when flying on the wings
of love and behind the tails of four broken-winded hacks
to some wilderness, where &ldquo;transport and security entwine&rdquo;&mdash;the
anticipated scene of a delicious honeymoon.
Elliot, while in search of a vessel, had fallen in with a
young man whom he had known as a medical student at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Edinburgh, and who was now about to go as surgeon of a
Greenland vessel, in order to earn, during the summer,
the necessary sum for defraying his college expenses. He
accompanied Elliot to his inn, and heard, during the way,
the story of his misfortunes. It is unnecessary to describe
Frank&#8217;s surprise and grief at the capture of his friend,
Rhimeson. At first, he determined instantly to return and
relieve him from durance. But, influenced by the entreaties
contained in Rhimeson&#8217;s note, and by the arguments
of the young Northumbrian, he at length changed
this resolution, and determined on accepting the situation
of surgeon in the whaling vessel for which his present
companion had been about to depart. Frank presented
the Northumbrian with a sum more than equal to the
expected profits of the voyage, and received his thanks in
tones wherein the natural roughness of his accent was
increased to a fearful degree by the strength of his emotion.
All things being arranged, Frank shook his acquaintance
by the hand, and remarked that it would be well for him
to keep out of the way for a while. So bidding the man
of harsh aspirations adieu, he made his way to the coach,
and, in twenty-four hours, was embarked in the <em>Labrador</em>,
with a stiff westerly breeze ready to carry him away from
all that he loved and dreaded.</p>

<p>Let the reader imagine that six months have passed over&mdash;and
let him imagine, also, if he can, the anguish which
the mother and sister of Elliot suffered on account of his
mysterious disappearance. It was now September. The
broad harvest moon was shining full upon the bosom of
Teviot, and glittering upon the rustling leaves of the woods
that overhang her banks, and pouring a flood of more
golden light upon the already golden grain that waved&mdash;ripe
for the sickle&mdash;along the margin of the lovely stream,
the stars, few in number, but most brilliant, had taken
their places in the sky; the owl was whooping from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
ivied tower; the corn-craik was calling drowsily; now and
then the distant baying of a watch-dog startled the silence,
otherwise undisturbed, save by the plaintive murmuring
of the stream, which, as it flowed past, uttered such
querulous sounds, that, as some one has happily expressed
it, &ldquo;one was almost tempted to ask what ailed it.&rdquo; A
traveller was moving slowly up the side of the river, and
ever and anon stopping, as if to muse over some particular
object. It was Elliot. He had returned from Greenland,
and, in disguise, had come to the place of his birth&mdash;to the
dwelling of his mother and his sister; he had heard that
his mother was ill&mdash;that anxiety, on his account, had
reduced her almost to the grave&mdash;and that she was now
but slowly recovering. He had been able to acquire no
information respecting Whitaker; and the weight of his
friend&#8217;s blood lay yet heavy on his soul, for he considered
himself as his murderer. It was with feelings of the most
miserable anxiety that he approached the place of his
birth. The stately beeches that lined the avenue which
led to his mother&#8217;s door were in sight; they stooped and
raised their stately branches, with all the gorgeous drapery
of leaves, as if they welcomed him back; the very river
seemed to utter, in accents familiar to him, that he was
now near the hall of his fathers. Oh! how is the home of
our youth enshrined in our most sacred affections! by
what multitudinous fibres is it entwined with our heart-strings!&mdash;it
is part of our being&mdash;its influences remain with
us for ever, though years spent in foreign lands divide us
from &ldquo;our early home that cradled life and love.&rdquo; Elliot
was framed to feel keenly these sacred influences&mdash;and
often, even after brief absences from home, he had experienced
them in deep intensity; but now the throb of
exultation was kept down by the crushing weight of remorse,
and the gush of tenderness checked by bitter fears.
He entered the avenue which led up to the house. Yonder
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
were the windows of his mother&#8217;s chamber&mdash;there was a
light in it. He would have given worlds to have seen
before him the interior. As he quickened his pace, he
heard the sound of voices in the avenue. He turned aside
out of the principal walk; and, standing under the branches
of a venerable beech, which swept down almost to the
ground, and fully concealed him, he waited the approach
of the speakers, in hopes of hearing some intelligence
respecting his family. Through the screen of the leaves
he presently saw that it was a pair of lovers, for their arms
were locked around each other, and their cheeks were
pressed together as they came down the avenue&mdash;treading
as slowly as though they were attempting to show how
much of rest there might be in motion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, then, my sweet Harriet,&rdquo; said the young
man, &ldquo;I leave you; and though it is torture to me to be
away from your side, yet I have resolved never again to
see you until I have made the most perfect search for your
brother; until I can win a dearer embrace than any I have
yet received, by placing him before you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would to heaven it may be so!&rdquo; replied the young
lady; &ldquo;but my mother&mdash;how will I be able to support her
when you are gone, dearest Henry? She is kept up only
by the happy strains of hope which your very voice creates.
How shall I, myself unsupported, ever keep her from
despondency? Oh! she will sink&mdash;she will die! Remain
with us, Henry; and let us trust to providence to restore
my brother to us&mdash;if he be yet alive!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask it not, my beloved Harriet, I beseech you,&rdquo; said
the young man, &ldquo;lest I be unable to deny you. If your
brother, as is likely, has sought some foreign land, and
remains in ignorance of my recovery from the wounds I
received from him, how shall I answer to myself&mdash;how
shall I even dare to ask for this fair hand&mdash;how shall I
ever hope to rest upon your bosom in peace&mdash;if I do not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
use every possible means to discover him? O my dear
Elliot&mdash;friend of my youth&mdash;if thou couldest translate the
language of my heart, as it beats at this moment&mdash;if thou
couldest hear my sacred resolve!&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whitaker, my friend! Harriet, my beloved sister!&rdquo;
cried Elliot, bursting out from beneath the overspreading
beech, and snatching his sister in his arms&mdash;&ldquo;I am here&mdash;I
see all&mdash;I understand the whole of the events&mdash;how much
too graciously brought about for me, Father of mercies! I
acknowledge. Let us now go to my mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is in scenes such as this that we find how weak words
are to describe the feelings of the actors&mdash;the rapid transition
of events&mdash;the passions that chase one another over
the minds and hearts of those concerned, like waves in a
tempest. Nor is it necessary. The reader who can feel
and comprehend such situations as those in which the
actors in our little tale are placed, are able to draw, from
their own hearts and imaginations, much fitter and more
rapidly sketched portraitures of the passions which are
awakened, the feelings that develop themselves in such situations
and with such persons, than can be painted in words.</p>

<p>The harvest moon was gone, and another young moon
was in the skies, when Whitaker, and the same young lady
of whom we before spoke, trode down the avenue, locked
in each other&#8217;s arms, and with cheek pressed to cheek.
They talked of a thousand things most interesting to persons
in their situation&mdash;for they were to be married on the
morrow&mdash;but, perhaps, not so interesting to our readers,
many of whom may have performed in the same scenes.</p>

<p>Elliot&#8217;s mother was recovered; and he himself was
happy, or, at least, he put on all the trappings of happiness;
for, in a huge deer-skin Esquimaux dress, which he
had brought from Greenland, he danced at his sister&#8217;s
wedding until the great bear had set in the sea, and the
autumn sun began to peer through the shutters of the
drawing-room of his ancient hall.</p>

<h2>PHILIPS GREY.</h2>

<div class="box">
<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
        &ldquo;Death takes a thousand shapes:<br />
Borne on the wings of sullen slow disease,<br />
Or hovering o&#8217;er the field of bloody fight,<br />
In calm, in tempest, in the dead of night,<br />
Or in the lightning of the summer moon;<br />
In all how terrible!&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Among the many scenes of savage sublimity which the
lowlands of Scotland display, there is none more impressive
in its solitary grandeur, than that in the neighbourhood
of Loch Skene, on the borders of Moffatdale. At a
considerable elevation above the sea, and surrounded by
the loftiest mountains in the south of Scotland, the loch
has collected its dark mass of waters, astonishing the lovers
of nature by its great height above the valley which he
has just ascended, and, by its still and terrible beauty,
overpowering his mind with sentiments of melancholy and awe.
Down the cliffs which girdle in the shores of the loch, and
seem to support the lofty piles of mountains above them,
a hundred mountain torrents leap from rock to rock, flashing
and roaring, until they reach the dark reservoir beneath.
A canopy of grey mist almost continually shrouds
from the sight the summits of the hills, leaving the
imagination to guess at those immense heights which seem
to pierce the very clouds of heaven. Occasionally, however,
this veil is withdrawn, and then you may see the
sovereign brow of Palmoodie encircled with his diadem of
snow, and the green summits of many less lofty hills
arranged round him, like courtiers uncovered before their
monarch. Amid this scene, consecrated to solitude and
the most sombre melancholy, no sound comes upon the
mountain breeze, save the wail of the plover, or the whir
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
of the heathcock&#8217;s wing, or, haply, the sullen plunge of a
trout leaping up in the loch.</p>

<p>At times, indeed, the solitary wanderer may be startled
by the scream of the grey eagle, as dropping with the
rapidity of light from his solitary cliff, he shoots past, enraged
that his retreat is polluted by the presence of man,
and then darts aloft into the loftiest chambers of the sky;
or, dallying with the piercing sunbeams, is lost amid their
glory.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a>
At the eastern extremity of the loch, the superfluous
waters are discharged by a stream of no great size,
but which, after heavy showers, pours along its deep and
turbid torrent with frightful impetuosity.</p>

<p>After running along the mountain for about half a mile,
it suddenly precipitates itself over the edge of a rocky ridge
which traverses its course, and, falling sheer down a height
of three hundred feet, leaps and bounds over some smaller
precipices, until, at length, far down in Moffatdale, it
entirely changes its character, and pursues a calm and
peaceful course through a fine pastoral country. Standing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
on the brow of a mountain which overlooks the fall, the
eye takes in at once the whole of the course which we
have described; and, to a poetical mind, which recognises
in mountain scenery the cradle of liberty and the favourite
dwelling-place of imagination, the character of the stream
seems a type of the human mind: stormy, bounding, and
impetuous, when wrapped up in the glorious feelings
which belong to romantic countries; peaceful, dull, and
monotonous, amid the less interesting lowlands. Yet,
after indulging in such a fancy for a time, another reflection
arises, which, if it be less pleasing and poetical, is,
perhaps, more useful&mdash;that the impetuous course of the
mountain torrent, though gratifying to the lover of nature,
is unaccompanied with any other benefit to man, while the
stream that pursues its unpretending path through the
plains, bestows fertility on a thousand fields. Such
thoughts as these, however, only arise in the mind when
it has become somewhat familiar with the surrounding
scenes. The roar of the cataract, the savage appearance
of the dark rocks that border the falling waters, and that
painful feeling which the sweeping and inevitable course
of the stream produces, at first paralyze the mind, and, for
some time after it has recovered its tone, occupy it to the
exclusion of every other sentiment.</p>

<p>And now, gentle reader, let us walk toward the simple
stone seat, which some shepherd boy has erected under yon
silvery-stemmed birch tree, where the sound of the waterfall
comes only in a pleasant monotone, and where the
most romantic part of old Scotland is spread beneath our
feet. There you see the eternal foam of the torrent, without
being distracted with its roar; and you can trace the
course of the stream till it terminates in yon clear and
pellucid pool at the foot of the hill, which seems too pure
for aught but&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
&ldquo;A mirror and a bath for beauty&#8217;s youngest daughters;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
yet, beautiful in its purity as it seems, it is indeed the
scene of the following true and terrible tale:&mdash;</p>

<p>Philips Grey was one of the most active young shepherds
in the parish of Traquair. For two or three years he had
carried off the medal given at the St. Ronan&#8217;s border
games to him who made the best high leap; and, at the
last meeting of the games, he had been first at the running
hop-step-and-jump; had beat all competitors in running;
and, though but slightly formed, had gained the second
prize for throwing the hammer&mdash;a favourite old Scottish
exercise, but almost unknown in England. Athletic sports
were, indeed, his favourite pursuit, and he cultivated them
with an ardour which very few of our readers will be able
to imagine. But among the shepherds, and, indeed, all
inhabitants of pastoral districts, he who excels in these
sports possesses a superiority over his contemporaries,
which cannot but be gratifying in the highest degree to
its possessor. His name is known far and wide; his
friendship is courted by the men; and his hand, either as
a partner in a country dance, or in a longer &ldquo;minuet of
the heart,&rdquo; marriage, is coquetted for by the maidens:
he, in fact, possesses all the power which superiority of
intellect bestows in more populous and polished societies.
But it is by no means the case, as is often said, that ardour
in the pursuit of violent sports is connected with ignorance
or mediocrity of intellect. On the contrary, by far the
greater number of victors at games of agility and strength,
will be found to possess a degree of mental energy, which is,
in fact, the power that impels them to corporeal excitement,
and is often the secret of their success over more muscular
antagonists. Philips Grey, in particular, was a striking
instance of this fact. Notwithstanding his passion for
athletic sports, he had found time, while on the hillside
tending his flock, or in the long winter nights, to make
himself well acquainted with the Latin classics. This is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
by no means uncommon among the Scottish peasantry.
Smith, and Black, and Murray, are not singular instances
of self-taught scholars; for there is scarce a valley in
Scotland in which you will not hear of one or more young
men of this stamp. Philips also played exquisitely on the
violin, and had that true taste for the simple Scottish
melody which can, perhaps, be nowhere cultivated so well
as among the mountains and streams which have frequently
inspired them. Many a time, when you ask the name of
the author of some sweet ballad which the country girl is
breathing amongst these hills, the tear will start into her
eye as she answers&mdash;&ldquo;Poor Philips Grey, that met a
dreadful death at the Grey Mare&#8217;s Tail.&rdquo; With these
admirable qualities, Philips unfortunately possessed a
mood of mind which is often an attendant on genius&mdash;he
was subject to attacks of the deepest melancholy. Gay,
cheerful, humorous, active, and violent in his sports as he
was, there were periods when the darkest gloom overshadowed
his mind, and when his friends even trembled
for his reason. It is said that he frequently stated his
belief that he should die a dreadful death. Alas! that
this strange presentiment should have indeed been prophetic!
It is not surprising that Philips Grey, with his
accomplishments, should have won the heart of a maiden
somewhat above his own degree, and even gained the
consent of her father to his early marriage. The old man
dwelt in Moffatdale; and the night before Philips&#8217; wedding-day,
he and his younger brother walked over to his intended
father-in-law&#8217;s house, in order to be nearer the church.
That night the young shepherd was in his gayest humour;
his bonny bride was by his side, and looking more beautiful
than ever; he sang his finest songs, played his favourite
tunes, and completely bewitched his companions. All on
a sudden, while he was relating some extraordinary feat of
strength which had been performed by one of his acquaintances,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
he stopped in the middle of the story, and exchanged
the animation with which he was speaking for silence and
a look of the deepest despair. His friends were horror-struck;
but as he insisted that nothing was the matter
with him, and as his younger brother said that he had not
been in bed for two nights, the old man dismissed the
family, saying&mdash;&ldquo;Gang awa to bed, Philips, my man, and
get a sound sleep; or if you do lie wauken a wee bittie,
it&#8217;s nae great matter: odd! it&#8217;s the last nicht my bonny
Marion &#8217;ll keep ye lying wauken for her sake. Will&#8217;t no,
my bonnie doo?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deed, faither, I dinna ken,&rdquo; quoth Marion, simply,
yet archly; and the party separated.</p>

<p>Philips, however, walked down the burn side, in order
to try if the cool air would dissipate his unaccountable
anxiety. But, in spite of his efforts, a presentiment of
some fatal event gathered strength in his mind, and he
involuntarily found himself revolving the occurrences of
his past life. Here he found little to condemn, for he had
never received an unkind word from his father, who was
now in the grave; and his mother was wearing out a
green and comfortable old age beneath his own roof. He
had brought up his younger brothers, and they were now
in a fair way to succeed in life. He could not help feeling
satisfied at this, yet why peculiarly at this time he knew
not. Then came the thought of his lovely Marion, and
the very agony which at once rushed on his heart had
well nigh choked him. Immediately, however, the fear
which had hung about him seemed to vanish; for, strange
and mysterious as it was, it was not sufficiently powerful
to withstand the force of that other horrible imagination.
So he returned to the house, and was surprised to find
himself considering how his little property should be
distributed after his death. When he reached the door, he
stopped for a moment, overcome with this pertinacity in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the supernatural influence which seemed exercised over
him; and at length, with gloomy resolution, entered the
house. His brother was asleep, and a candle was burning
on the table. He sank down into a chair, and went on
with his little calculations respecting his will. At length,
having decided upon all these things, and having fixed
upon the churchyard of St. Mary&#8217;s for his burial place, he
arose from his chair, took up the candle and crossed the
room towards his brother, intending to convey his wishes
to him.</p>

<p>The boy lay on the front side of one of those beds with
sliding doors, so common in Scotland; and beyond him
there was room for Philips to lie down. Something bright
seemed gleaming in the dark recess of the bed. He advanced
the candle, and beheld&mdash;oh, sight of horror!&mdash;a
plate upon what bore the shape of a coffin, bearing the
words&mdash;&ldquo;Philips Grey, aged 23.&rdquo; For a moment he
gazed steadily upon it, and was about to stretch out his
hand towards it, when the lid slowly rose, and he beheld
a mutilated and bloody corpse, the features of which were
utterly undistinguishable, but which, by some unearthly
impulse, he instantly knew to be his own. Still he kept
a calm and unmoved gaze at it, though the big drops of
sweat stood on his brow with the agony of his feelings;
and, while he was thus contemplating the dreadful revelation,
it gradually faded away, and at length totally
vanished. The power which had upheld him seemed to
depart along with the phantom; his sight failed him, and
he fell on the floor.</p>

<p>Presently he recovered, and found himself in bed, with
his brother by his side chafing his temples. He explained
everything that had occurred, seemed calm and collected,
shook his head when his brother attempted to explain away
the vision, and finally sank into a tranquil sleep.</p>

<p>Whether the horrible resemblance of his own coffin and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
mutilated corpse was in reality revealed to him by the
agency of some supernatural power, or whether it was (as
sceptics will say) the natural effect of his hypochondriac
state of mind, producing an optical deception, we will not
take upon us to determine; certain, however, it is, that
with a calm voice and collected manner he described to
his brother James, a scene the dreadful reality of which
was soon to be displayed.</p>

<p>In the morning Philips awoke, cheerful and calm, the
memory of last night&#8217;s occurrences seeming but a dreadful
dream. On the grass before the door he met his beloved
Marion, who, on that blessed Sabbath, was to become his
wife. The sight of her perfect loveliness, arrayed in a
white dress, emblem of purity and innocence, filled his
heart with rapture; and as he clasped her in his arms,
every sombre feeling vanished away. It is not our intention
to describe the simplicity of the marriage ceremony, or the
happiness which filled Philips Grey&#8217;s heart during that
Sabbath morning, while sitting in the church by the side
of his lovely bride.</p>

<p>They returned home, and, in the afternoon, the young
couple, together with James Grey and the bride&#8217;s-maid,
walked out among the glades of Craigieburn wood, a spot
rendered classic by the immortal Burns. Philips had
gathered some of the wild flowers that sprang among their
feet&mdash;the pale primrose, the fair anemone, and the drooping
blue bells of Scotland&mdash;and wove them into a garland.
As he was placing them on Marion&#8217;s brow, and shading
back the long flaxen tresses that hung across her cheek,
he said, gaily&mdash;&ldquo;There wants but a broad water lily to
place in the centre of thy forehead, my sweet Marion; for
where should the fairest flower of the valley be, but on the
brow of its queen? Come with me, Jamie, and in half an
hour we will bring the fairest that floats on Loch Skene.&rdquo;
So, kissing the cheek of his bride, Philips and his brother
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
set off up the hill with the speed of the mountain deer.
They arrived at the foot of the waterfall, panting, and
excited with their exertions. By climbing up the rocks
close to the stream, the distance to the loch is considerably
shortened; and Philips, who had often clambered to the
top of the Bitch Craig, a high cliff on the Manor
Water, proposed to his brother that they should &ldquo;speel
the height.&rdquo; The other, a supple agile lad, instantly
consented. &ldquo;Gie me your plaid then, Jamie, my man&mdash;it
will maybe fash ye,&rdquo; said Philips; &ldquo;and gang ye first, and
keep weel to the hill side.&rdquo; Accordingly the boy gave his
brother the plaid and began the ascent. While Philips
was knotting his brother&#8217;s plaid round his body above his
own, a fox peeped out of his hole half way up the cliff,
and thinking flight advisable, dropped down the precipice.
Laughing till the very echoes rang, Philips followed his
brother. Confident in his agility, he ascended with a firm
step till he was within a few yards of the summit. James
was now on the top of the precipice, and looking down on
his brother, and not knowing the cause of his mirth,
exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Daursay, callant, ye&#8217;re
fey.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>
In a moment
the memory of his last night&#8217;s vision rushed on Philips
Grey&#8217;s mind, his eyes became dim, his limbs powerless, he
dropped off the very edge of the giddy precipice, and his
form was lost in the black gulf below. For a few minutes,
James felt a sickness of heart which rendered him almost
insensible, and sank down on the grass lest he should fall
over the cliff. At length, gathering strength from very
terror, he advanced to the edge of the cataract and gazed
downwards. There, about two-thirds down the fall, he
could perceive the remains of his brother, mangled and
mutilated; the body being firmly wedged between two
projecting points of rock, whereon the descending water
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
streamed, while the bleeding head hung dangling, and
almost separated from the body&mdash;and, turned upwards,
discovered to the horrified boy the starting eye-balls
of his brother, already fixed in death, and the teeth
clenched in the bitter agony which had tortured his passing
spirit.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to detail the consequences of
this cruel accident. Assistance was procured, and the
mangled body conveyed to the house of Marion&#8217;s father,
whence, a few short hours ago, the young shepherd had
issued in vigour and happiness. When the widowed bride
saw James Grey return to them with horror painted on
his features, she seemed instantly to divine the full extent
of her misfortune; she sank down on the grass, with the
unfinished garland of her dead lover in her hand, and in
this state was carried home. For two days she passed
from one fit to another; but on the night of the second
day she sank into a deep sleep. That night, James Grey
was watching the corpse of his brother; the coffin was
placed on the very bed where they had slept two nights
ago. The plate gleamed from the shadowy recess, and the
words&mdash;&ldquo;Philips Grey, aged 23,&rdquo; were distinctly visible.
While James was reflecting on the prophetic vision of his
brother, a figure, arrayed in white garments, entered the
room and moved towards the dead body. It was poor Marion.</p>

<p>She slowly lifted the lid of the coffin, and gazed long
and intently on the features of her dead husband. Then,
turning round to James, she uttered a short shrill shriek,
and fell backwards on the corpse. She hovered between
life and death for a few days, and at length expired. She
now lies by the side of her lover, in the solitary burial
ground of St. Mary&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Such is the event which combines, with others not less
dark and terrible, to throw a wild interest around those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
gloomy rocks. Many a time you will hear the story from
the inhabitants of those hills; and, until fretted away by
the wind and rain, the plaid and the bonnet of the unfortunate
Philips Grey hung upon the splintered precipice to
attest the truth of the tale.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>
<h2>DONALD GORM.</h2>


<p>In a remote corner of Assynt, one of the most remote and
savage districts in the Highlands of Scotland, there is a
certain wild and romantic glen, called Eddernahulish. In
the picturesqueness of this glen, however, neither wood nor
rock has any share; and, although it may be difficult to
conceive of any place possessing that character without
these ordinary adjuncts, it is, nevertheless, true, that
Eddernahulish, with neither tree nor precipice, is yet
strikingly picturesque. The wide sweep of the heath-clad
hills whose gradual descents form the spacious glen, and
the broad and brawling stream careering through its
centre, give the place an air of solitude and of quiet repose
that, notwithstanding its monotony, is exceedingly impressive.</p>

<p>On gaining any of the many points of elevation that
command a view of this desolate strath, you may descry,
towards its western extremity, a small, rude, but massive
stone bridge, grey with age; for it was erected in the time
of that laird of Assynt who rendered himself for ever
infamous by betraying the Duke of Montrose, who had
sought and obtained the promise of his protection, to his
enemies.</p>

<p>Close by this bridge stands a little highland cottage, of,
however, a considerably better order than the common run
of such domiciles in this quarter of the world; and bespeaking
a condition, as to circumstances, on the part of its
occupants, which is by no means general in the Highlands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well what of this cottage?&rdquo; says the impatient reader.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
&ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; say we, with the proud consciousness of
having something worth hearing to tell of it. &ldquo;Why, was
it not the birthplace of Donald Gorm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, pray, who or what was Donald Gorm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were just going to tell you when you interrupted
us; and we will now proceed to the fulfilment of that
intention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Donald Gorm was a rough, rattling, outspoken, hot-headed,
and warm-hearted highlander, of about two-and-thirty
years of age. Bold as a lion, and strong as a
rhinoceros, with great bodily activity, he feared nobody;
and having all the irascibility of his race, would fight with
anybody at a moment&#8217;s notice. Possessing naturally a
great flow of animal spirits and much ready wit, Donald
was the life and soul of every merry-making in which he
bore a part. In the dance, his joyous whoop and haloo
might be heard a mile off; and the hilarious crack of his
finger and thumb, nearly a third of that distance. Donald,
in short, was one of those choice spirits that are always
ready for anything, and who, by the force of their individual
energies, can keep a whole country-side in a stir.
As to his occupations, Donald&#8217;s were various&mdash;sometimes
farming, (assisting his father, with whom he lived,) sometimes
herring fishing, and sometimes taking a turn at
harvest work in the Lowlands&mdash;by which industry he had
scraped a few pounds together; and, being unmarried, with
no one to care for but himself, he was thus comparatively
independent&mdash;a circumstance which kept Donald&#8217;s head at
its highest elevation, and his voice, when he spoke, at the
top of its bent.</p>

<p>The tenor of our story requires that we should now
advert to another member of Donald&#8217;s family. This is a
brother of the latter&#8217;s, who bore the euphonious and high-flavoured
patronymic of Duncan Dhu M&#699;Tavish Gorm, or,
simply, Duncan Gorm, as he was, for shortness, called,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
although certainly baptized by the formidable list of names
just given.</p>

<p>This Duncan Gorm was a man of totally different
character from his brother Donald. He was of a quiet
and peaceable disposition and demeanour&mdash;steady, sober,
and conscientious; qualities which were thought to adapt
him well for the line of life in which he was placed.
This was as a domestic servant in the family of an extensive
highland proprietor, of the name of Grant. In this
capacity Duncan had, about a year or so previous to the
precise period when our story commences&mdash;which, by the
way, we beg the reader to observe, is now some ninety
years past&mdash;gone to the continent, as a personal attendant
on the elder son of his master, whose physicians had recommended
his going abroad for the benefit of his health.</p>

<p>It was, then, about a year after the departure of Duncan
and his master, that Donald&#8217;s father received a letter from
his son, intimating the death of his young master, which
had taken place at Madrid, and, what was much more surprising
intelligence, that the writer had determined on
settling in the city just named, as keeper of a tavern or
wine-house, in which calling he said he had no doubt he
would do well. And he was not mistaken; in about six
months after, his family received another letter from him,
informing them that he was succeeding beyond his most
sanguine expectations&mdash;and hereby hangs our tale.</p>

<p>On Donald these letters of his brother&#8217;s made a very
strong impression; and, finally, had the effect of inducing
him to adopt a very strange and very bold resolution.
This was neither more nor less than to join his brother in
Madrid&mdash;a resolution from which it was found impossible
to dissuade him, especially after the receipt of Duncan&#8217;s
second letter, giving intimation of his success.</p>

<p>With most confused and utterly inadequate notions,
therefore, of either the nature, or distance, or position of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the country to which he was going, Donald made preparations
for his journey. But they were merely such
preparations as he would have made for a descent on the
Lowlands, at harvest time. He put up some night-caps,
stockings, and shirts in a bundle, with a quantity of bread
and cheese, and a small flask of his native mountain dew.
This bundle he proposed to suspend, in the usual way,
over his shoulder on the end of a huge oak stick, which
he had carefully selected for the purpose. And it was thus
prepared&mdash;with, however, an extra supply of his earnings
in his pocket, of which he had a vague notion he would
stand in need&mdash;that Donald contemplated commencing his
journey to Madrid from the heart of the Highlands of
Scotland. In one important particular, however, did
Donald&#8217;s outfit on this occasion, differ from that adopted
on ordinary occasions. On the present, he equipped himself
in the full costume of his country&mdash;kilt, plaid, bonnet
and feather, sword, dirk, and pistols; and thus arrayed,
his appearance was altogether very striking, as he was
both a stout and exceedingly handsome man.</p>

<p>Before starting on his extraordinary expedition, Donald
had learned which was the fittest seaport whereat to embark
on his progress to Spain; and it was nearly all he had
learned, or indeed cared to inquire about, as to the place
of his destination. For this port, then, he finally set out;
but over his proceedings, for somewhere about three weeks
after this, there is a veil which our want of knowledge of
facts and circumstances will not enable us to withdraw.
Of all subsequent to this, however, we are amply informed;
and shall now proceed to give the reader the full benefit
of that information.</p>

<p>Heaven knows how Donald had fought his way to
Madrid, or what particular route he had taken to attain
this consummation; but certain it is, that, about the end
of the three weeks mentioned, the identical Donald Gorm
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
of whom we speak, kilted and hosed as he left Eddernahulish,
with a huge stick over his shoulder bearing a
bundle suspended on its farthest extremity, was seen, early
in the afternoon, approaching the gate of Alcala, one of the
principal and most splendid entrances into the Spanish
capital. Donald was staring about him, and at everything
he saw, with a look of the greatest wonder and amazement;
and strange were the impressions that the peculiar dresses
of those he met, and the odd appearance of the buildings
within his view, made upon his unsophisticated mind and
bewildered sensorium.</p>

<p>He, in truth, felt very much as if he had by some
accident got into the moon, or some other planet than
that of which he was a born inhabitant, and as if the
beings around him were human only in form and feature.
The perplexity and confusion of his ideas were, indeed,
great&mdash;so great that he found it impossible to reduce them
to such order as to give them one single distinct impression.
There were, however, two points in Donald&#8217;s character,
which remained wholly unaffected by the novelty of
his position. These were his courage and bold bearing.
Not all Spain, nor all that was in Spain, could have deprived
Donald of these for a moment. He was amazed,
but not in the least awed. He was, in truth, looking
rather fiercer than usual, at this particular juncture, in
consequence of a certain feeling of irritation, caused by
what he deemed the impertinent curiosity of the passers-by,
who, no less struck with his strange appearance than
he with theirs, were gazing and tittering at him from all
sides&mdash;treatment this, at which Donald thought fit to take
mortal offence. Having arrived, however, at the gate of
Alcala, Donald thought it full time to make some inquiries
as to where his relative resided. Feeling impressed with
the propriety of this step, he made up to a group of idle,
equivocal-looking fellows, who, wrapped up in long buttoned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
dilapidated cloaks, were lounging about the gate; and,
plunging boldly into the middle of them, he delivered himself
thus, in his best English:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, freens, did you&#8217;ll know, any of you, where my
broder stops?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men, as might be expected, first stared at the
speaker, and then burst out a-laughing in his face. They,
of course, could not comprehend a word of what he said;
a circumstance on the possibility of which it had never
struck Donald to calculate, and to which he did not now
advert. Great, therefore, was his wrath, at this, apparently,
contemptuous treatment by the Spaniards. His
highland blood mounted to his face, and with the
same rapidity rose his highland choler. Donald, in
truth, already contemplated doing battle in defence of
his insulted consequence, and at once hung out his flag
of defiance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You tam scarecrow-lookin rascals!&rdquo; he sputtered out,
in great fury, at the same time shaking his huge clenched
brown fist in the faces of the whole group, their numbers
not in the least checking his impetuosity&mdash;&ldquo;You cowartly,
starvation-like togs! I&#8217;ve a goot mind to make smashed
potatoes o&#8217; the whole boilin o&#8217; ye. Tam your Spanish noses
and whiskers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fierce and determined air of Donald had the effect of
instantly restoring the gravity of the Spaniards, who,
totally at a loss to comprehend what class of the human
species he represented, looked at him with a mingled expression
of astonishment and respect. At length, one of
their number discharged a volley of his native language at
Donald; but it was, apparently, of civil and good-natured
import, for it was delivered in a mild tone, and accompanied
by a conciliatory smile. On Donald, the language
was, of course, utterly lost&mdash;he did not comprehend a
word of it; but not so the indications of a friendly disposition
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
to which we have alluded; these he at once appreciated,
and they had the effect of allaying his wrath a little,
and inducing him to make another attempt at a little civil
colloquy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Donald, now somewhat more calmly, &ldquo;I
was shust ask you a ceevil question, an&#8217; you laugh in my
face, which is not ceevil. In my country we don&#8217;t do that
to anybody, far less a stranger. Noo, may pe, you&#8217;ll not
know my broder, and there&#8217;s no harm in that&mdash;none at
all; but you should shust have say so at once, an&#8217; there
would be no more apout it. Can none of you speak
Gaelic?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this inquiry, which was understood to be such, there
was a general shaking of heads amongst the Spaniards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oich, oich, it must be a tam strange country where
there&#8217;s no Gaelic. But, never mind&mdash;you cannot help
your misfortunes. I say, lads, will ye teuk a tram. Hooch,
hurra! prof, prof! Let&#8217;s get a dram.&rdquo; And Donald flung
up one of his legs hilariously, while he gave utterance
to these uncouth expletives, which he did in short joyous
shouts. &ldquo;Where will we go, lads? Did you&#8217;ll know any
decen&#8217; public-house, where we&#8217;ll can depend on a goot
tram?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this invitation, and to the string of queries by which
it was accompanied, Donald got in reply only a repetition
of that shake of the head which intimated non-comprehension.
But it was an instance of the latter that surprised
him more than all the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, to be surely,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if a man&#8217;ll not understand
the offer of a tram, he&#8217;ll understand nothing, and it&#8217;s
no use saying more. Put maybe you&#8217;ll understand the
sign, if not the word.&rdquo; And, saying this, he raised his
closed hand to his lips and threw back his head, as if taking
off a <em>caulker</em> of his own mountain dew; pointing, at
the same time, to a house which seemed to him to have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
the appearance of one of public entertainment. To
Donald&#8217;s great satisfaction, he found that he had now
made himself perfectly intelligible; a fact which he recognised
in the smiles and nods of his auditory, and, still
more unequivocally, in the general movement which they
made after him to the &ldquo;public-house,&rdquo; to which he immediately
directed his steps.</p>

<p>At the head, then, of this troop of tatterdemallions, and
walking with as stately a step as a drum-major, Donald
may be said to have made his entrance into Madrid; and
rather an odd first appearance of that worthy there, it certainly
was. On entering the tavern or inn which he had
destined for the scene of his hospitalities, he strode in
much in the same style that he would have entered a
public-house in Lochaber&mdash;namely, slapping the first person
he met on the shoulder, and shouting some merry greeting
or other appropriate to the occasion. This precisely
Donald did in the present instance, to the great amazement
and alarm of a very pretty Spanish girl, who was performing
the duty of ushering in customers, inclusive of that of
subsequently supplying their wants. On feeling the enormous
paw of Donald on her shoulder, and looking at the
strange attire in which he was arrayed, the girl uttered a
scream of terror, and fled into the interior of the house.
Unaccustomed to have his rude but hearty greetings received
in this way, or to find them producing an effect so
contrary to that which, in his honest warm-heartedness,
he intended them to produce, Donald was rather taken
aback by the alarm expressed by the girl; but soon recovering
his presence of mind&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oich, oich!&rdquo; he said, laughing, and turning to his
ragged crew behind him, &ldquo;ta lassie&#8217;s frightened for Shon
Heelanman. Puir thing! It&#8217;s weel seen she&#8217;s no peen
procht up in Lochaber, or maype&#8217;s no been lang in the
way o&#8217; keepin a public. It&#8217;s&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;&lsquo;Haut awa, bite awa,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Haut awa frae me, Tonal;</span><br />
 What care I for a&#8217; your wealth,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">An&#8217; a&#8217; that ye can gie, Tonal?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>And, chanting this stanza of a well-known Scottish ditty,
at the top of his voice, Donald bounced into the first open
door he could find, still followed by his tail. These having
taken their seats around a table which stood in the centre
of the apartment, he next commenced a series of thundering
raps on the board with the hilt of his dirk, accompanied
by stentorian shouts of, &ldquo;Hoy, lassie! House,
here! Hoy, hoy, hoy!&rdquo; a summons which was eventually
answered by the landlord in person, the girl&#8217;s report of
Donald&#8217;s appearance and salutation to herself having deterred
any other of the household from obeying the call of
so wild and noisy a customer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, honest man,&rdquo; said Donald, on the entrance of
his host, &ldquo;will you pe bringing us two half mutchkins of
your pest whisky. Here&#8217;s some honest lads I want to treat
to a tram.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The landlord, as might be expected, stared at this strange
guest, in utter unconsciousness of the purport of his demand.
Recollecting himself, however, after a moment,
his professional politeness returned, and he began bowing
and simpering his inability to comprehend what had been
addressed to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for you&#8217;ll boo, boo, and scrape, scrape there,
you tam ass!&rdquo; exclaimed Donald, furiously. &ldquo;Co and
pring us the whisky. Two half mutchkins, I say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the polite landlord of the Golden Eagle, which
was the name of the inn, bowed his non-comprehension of
what was said to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cot&#8217;s mercy! can you&#8217;ll not spoke English, either?&rdquo;
shouted Donald, despairingly, on his second rebuff, and at
the same time striking the table impatiently with his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
clenched fist. &ldquo;Can you&#8217;ll spoke Gaelic, then?&rdquo; he added;
and, without waiting for a reply, he repeated his demand
in that language. The experiment was unsuccessful.
Mine host of the Golden Eagle understood neither Gaelic
nor English. Finding this, Donald had once more recourse
to the dumb show of raising his hand to his mouth, as if in
the act of drinking; and once more he found the sign
perfectly intelligible. On its being made, the landlord
instantly retired, and in a minute after returned with a
couple of bottles in hand, and two very large-sized glasses,
which he placed on the table. Eyeing the bottles
contemptuously:&mdash;&ldquo;It&#8217;s no porter; it&#8217;s whisky I&#8217;ll order,&rdquo;
exclaimed Donald, angrily, conceiving that it was the
former beverage that had been brought him. &ldquo;Porter&#8217;s
drink for hocs, and not for human podies.&rdquo; Finding it
wholly impossible, however, to make this sentiment understood,
Donald was compelled to content himself with the
liquor which had been brought him. Under this conviction,
he seized one of the bottles, filled up a glass to the
brim, muttering the while &ldquo;that it was tam white, strange-looking
porter,&rdquo; started to his feet, and, holding the glass
extended in his hand, shouted the health of his ragged
company, in Gaelic, and bolted the contents. But the
effect of this proceeding was curious. The moment the
liquor, which was some of the common wine of Spain, was
over Donald&#8217;s throat, he stared wildly, as if he had just
done some desperate deed&mdash;swallowed an adder by mistake,
or committed some such awkward oversight. This expression
of horror was followed by the most violent sputterings
and hideous grimaces, accompanied by a prodigious assemblage
of curses of all sorts, in Gaelic and English, and
sometimes of an equal proportion of both.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oich, oich! poisoned, by Cot!&mdash;vinekar, horrid vinekar!
Lanlort, I say, what cursed stuffs is this you kive us?&rdquo;
And again Donald sputtered with an energy and perseverance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
that nothing but a sense of the utmost disgust and
loathing could have inspired. Both the landlord and
Donald&#8217;s own guests, at once comprehending his feelings
regarding the wine, hastened, by every act and sign they
could think of, to assure him that he was wrong in entertaining
so unfavourable an opinion of its character and
qualities. Mine host, filling up a glass, raised it to his
mouth, and, sipping a little of the liquor, smacked his lips,
in token of high relish of its excellences. He then handed
the glass round the company, all of whom tasted and
approved, after the same expressive fashion; and thus,
without a word being said, a collective opinion, hollow
against Donald, was obtained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, trink the apominations, and be curst to
you!&rdquo; said Donald, who perfectly understood that judgment
had gone against him, &ldquo;and much goot may&#8217;t do
you! but mysel would sooner trink the dirty bog water of
Sleevrechkin. Oich, oich! the dirts! But I say, lanlort,
maype you&#8217;ll have got some prandies in the house? I can
make shift wi&#8217; that when there&#8217;s no whisky to be cot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fortunately for Donald, mine host of the Golden Eagle
at once understood the word brandy, and, understanding
it, lost no time in placing a measure of that liquor before
him; and as little time did Donald lose in swallowing an
immense bumper of the inspiring alcohol.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Donald, with a look of great satisfaction, on
performing this feat, &ldquo;that&#8217;s something like a human
Christian&#8217;s trink. No your tam vinekar, as would colic a
horse.&rdquo; Saying this, he filled up and discussed another
modicum of the brandy; his followers, in the meantime,
having done the same duty by the two bottles of wine,
which were subsequently replaced by another two, by the
order of their hospitable entertainer. On Donald, however,
his libations were now beginning to produce, in a very
marked manner, their usual effects. He was first getting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
into a state of high excitation; thumping the table violently
with his fist, and sputtering out furious discharges of
Gaelic and English, mingled in one strange and unintelligible
mess of words, and seemingly oblivious of the fact
that not a syllable of what he said could be comprehended
by his auditory. This, then, was a circumstance which
did not hinder him from entertaining his friends with a
graphic description of Eddernahulish, and a very animated
account of a particular deer-chase in which he had once
been engaged. In short, in the inspiration of the hour,
Donald seemed to have entirely forgotten every circumstance
connected with his present position. He appeared
to have forgotten that he was in a foreign land; forgotten
the purpose that brought him there; forgotten his brother;
forgotten those associated with him were Spaniards, not
Atholemen; in truth, forgotten everything he should have
recollected. In this happy state of obfuscation, Donald
continued to roar, to drink, and to talk away precisely as
he was wont to do in Rory M&#699;Fadyen&#8217;s &ldquo;public&rdquo; in Kilnichrochokan.
From being oratorical, Donald became musical,
and insisted on having a song from some of his friends;
but failing to make his request intelligible, he volunteered
one himself, and immediately struck up, in a
strong nasal twang, and with a voice that made the whole
house ring:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Ta Heelan hills are high, high, high,</span><br />
 An&#8217; ta Heelan miles are long;<br />
 But, then, my freens, rememper you,<br />
 Ta Heelan whisky&#8217;s strong, strong, strong!<br />
        <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Ta Heelan whisky&#8217;s strong,</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;And who shall care for ta length o&#8217; ta mile,</span><br />
 Or who shall care for ta hill,<br />
 If he shall have, &#8217;fore he teukit ta way,<br />
 In him&#8217;s cheek one Heelan shill?<br />
        <span style="margin-left: 3em;">In him&#8217;s cheek one Heelan shill?</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;An&#8217; maype he&#8217;ll pe teukit twa;</span><br />
 I&#8217;ll no say is no pe tree;<br />
 And what although it should pe four?<br />
 Is no pussiness you or me, me, me&mdash;<br />
          <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Is no pussiness you or me.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Suiting the action to, at least, the spirit of the song,
Donald tossed off another bumper of the alcohol, which
had the rather odd effect of recalling him to some sense of
his situation, instead of destroying, as might have been
expected, any little glimmering of light on that subject
which he might have previously possessed. On discussing
the last glass of brandy&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, lads,&rdquo; said Donald, &ldquo;I must pe going. It&#8217;s gettin
late, and I must find oot my brother Tuncan Gorm, as
decen&#8217; a lad as between this and Eddernahulish.&rdquo; Having
said this, and paid his reckoning, Donald began shaking
hands with his friends, one after the other, previous to
leaving them; but his friends had no intention whatever
of parting with him in this way. Donald had incautiously
exposed his wealth when settling with the landlord; and
of his wealth, as well as his wine, they determined on
having a share. The ruffians, in short, having communicated
with each other, by nods and winks, resolved to dog
him; and, when fitting place and opportunity should present
themselves, to rob and murder him. Fortunately for
Donald, however, they had not exchanged intelligence so
cautiously as to escape his notice altogether. He had seen
and taken note of two or three equivocal acts and motions
of his friends; but had had sufficient prudence, not only
to avoid all remark on them, but to seem as if he had not
observed them. Donald, indeed, could not well conceive
what these secret signals meant; but he felt convinced that
they meant &ldquo;no goot;&rdquo; and he therefore determined on
keeping a sharp look-out, not only while he was in the
presence of his boon companions, but after he should have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
left them; for he had a vague notion that they might
possibly follow him for some evil purpose.</p>

<p>Under this latter impression&mdash;which had occurred to
him only at the close of their orgie, no suspicion unfavourable
to the characters of his guests having before struck
him&mdash;Donald, on parting from the latter at the door of the
inn in which they had been regaling, might have been
heard muttering to himself, after he had got to some little
distance:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tam rogues, after all, I pelieve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having thus distinctly expressed his sentiments regarding
his late companions, Donald pursued his way, although
he was very far from knowing what that way should be.
Street after street he traversed, making frequent vain
inquiries for his &ldquo;broder, Tuncan Gorm,&rdquo; until midnight,
when he suddenly found himself in a large, open space,
intersected by alleys formed by magnificent trees, and
adorned by playing fountains of great beauty and elegance.
Donald had got into the Prado, or public promenade of
Madrid; but of the Prado Donald knew nothing; and
much, therefore, did he marvel at what sort of a place he
had got into. The fountains, in particular, perplexed and
amazed him; and it was while contemplating one of these,
with a sort of bewildered curiosity, that he saw a human
figure glide from one side to the other of the avenue in
which the object of his contemplation was situated, and at
the distance of about twenty yards. Donald was startled
by the apparition; and, recollecting his former associates,
clapped his right hand instinctively on the hilt of his
broadsword, and his left on the butt of a pistol&mdash;one of
those stuck in his belt&mdash;and in this attitude awaited the
re-appearance of the skulker; but he did not make himself
again visible. Donald, however, felt convinced that
there was danger at hand, and he determined to keep
himself prepared to encounter it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
&ldquo;Some o&#8217; ta vinekar-drinking rascals,&rdquo; muttered Donald.
&ldquo;It was no honest man&#8217;s drink; nor no goot can come o&#8217; a
country where they swallow such apominable liquors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus reasoned Donald with himself, as he stood vigilantly
scanning the localities around him, to prevent a sudden
surprise. While thus engaged, four different persons, all
at once, and as if they had acted by concert, started each
from behind a tree, and approached Donald from four
different points, with the purpose, evidently, of distracting
his attention. At once perceiving their intention, and not
doubting that their purposes were hostile, the intrepid
Celt, to prevent himself being surrounded, hastily retreated
to a wall which formed part of the structure of the fountain
on which he had been gazing, and, placing his back against
it, awaited, with his drawn sword in one hand and a pistol
in the other, the approach of his enemies, as he had no
doubt they were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my friends,&rdquo; said Donald, as they drew near
him, and discovered to him four tall fellows, swathed up
to the eyes in their cloaks, and each with a drawn sword
in his hand, &ldquo;what you&#8217;ll want with me?&rdquo; No answer
having been returned to this query, and the fellows continuing
to press on, although now more cautiously, as they
had perceived that their intended victim was armed, and
stood on the defensive: &ldquo;Py Shoseph!&rdquo; said Donald, &ldquo;you
had petter keep your distance, lads, or my name&#8217;s no Tonal
Gorm if I don&#8217;t gif some of you a dish of crowdy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, as good as his word, he almost instantly after fired
at the foremost of his assailants, and brought him down.
This feat performed, instead of waiting for the attack of
the other three, he instantly rushed on them sword in hand,
and, by the impetuosity of his attack, and fury of his blows,
rendered all their skill of fence useless. With his huge
weapon and powerful arm, both of which he plied with a
rapidity and force which there was no resisting, he broke
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
through their guards as easily as he would have beat down
so many osier wands, and wounded severely at every blow.
It was in vain that Donald&#8217;s assailants kept retiring before
him, in the hope of getting him at a disadvantage&mdash;of finding
an opportunity of having a cut or a thrust at him. No
time was allowed them for any such exploit. Donald kept
pressing on, and showering his tremendous blows on them
so thickly, that not an instant was left them for aggression
in turn. They were, besides, rapidly losing relish for the
contest, from the ugly blows they were getting, without a
possibility of returning them. Finding, at length, that the
contest was a perfectly hopeless one, Donald&#8217;s assailants
fairly took to their heels, and ran for it; but there was one
of their number who did not run far&mdash;a few yards, when
he fell down and expired. His hurts had been mortal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oich, oich, lad!&rdquo; said Donald, peering into the face of
the dead man, &ldquo;you&#8217;ll no pe shust that very weel, I&#8217;m
thinkin. The heelan claymore &#8217;ll not acree with your
Spanish stomach. But it&#8217;s goot medicine for rogues, for
all that.&rdquo; Having thus apostrophized the slain man, Donald
sheathed his weapon, muttering as he did so: &ldquo;Ta cowartly
togs can fight no more&#8217;s a turkey hens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, cocking his bonnet proudly, he commenced the
task of finding his way back to the city; a task which,
after a good many unnecessary, but, from his ignorance of
the localities, unavoidable deviations, he at length accomplished.</p>

<p>Donald&#8217;s most anxious desire now was to find a &ldquo;public&rdquo;
in which to quarter for the night; but, the hour
being late, this was no easy matter. Every door was
shut, and the streets lonely and deserted. At length,
however, our hero stumbled on what appeared to him to
be something of the kind he wanted, although he could
have wished it to have been on a fully smaller and
humbler scale. This was a large hotel, in which every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
window was blazing with light, and the rooms were filled
with mirthful music. Donald&#8217;s first impression was that
it was a penny wedding upon a great scale. It was, in
truth, a masquerade; and as the brandy which he had
drunk in the earlier part of the evening was still in his
head, he proposed to himself taking a very active part in
the proceedings. On entering the hotel, however, which
he did boldly, he was rather surprised at the splendours of
various kinds which greeted his eyes&mdash;marble stairs, gorgeous
lamps, gilt cornices, &amp;c., &amp;c., and sundry other
indications of grandeur which he had never seen equalled
even in Tain or Dingwall, to say nothing of his native parish
of Macharuarich, and he had been in his time in every
public-house of any repute in all of them. These circumstances
did not disabuse Donald of his original idea
of its being a penny-wedding. He only thought that
they conducted these things in greater style in Spain than
in Scotland, and with this solution of the difficulty, suggested
by the said splendours, Donald mounted the broad
marble staircase, and stalked into the midst of a large
apartment filled with dancers. The variety and elegance
of the dresses of these last again staggered Donald&#8217;s belief
in the nature of the merry-making, and made him doubt
whether he had conjectured aright. These doubts, however,
did not for an instant shake his determination to
have a share in the fun. It was a joyous dancing party,
and that was quite enough for him. In the meantime
he contented himself with staring at the strange but splendid
figures by whom he was surrounded, and who were,
in various corners of the apartment, gliding through
the &ldquo;mazy dance.&rdquo; But if Donald&#8217;s surprise was great
at the costumes which he was now so intently marking,
those who displayed them were no less surprised at
that which he exhibited. Donald&#8217;s strange, but striking
attire, in truth, had attracted all eyes; and much did those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
who beheld it wonder in all the earth to what country it
belonged. But simple wonder and admiration were not
the only sensations which Donald&#8217;s garb produced on the
masquers. His kilt had other effects. It drove half the
ladies screaming out of the apartment, to its wearer&#8217;s great
surprise and no small displeasure. The guise which
Donald wore, however, and which all believed to have
been donned for the occasion, was, on the whole, much
approved of, and the wearer, in more than one instance,
complimented for his taste in having selected so novel and
striking a garb. But even his warmest applauders objected
to the scantiness of the kilt, and hinted that, for decorum&#8217;s
sake, this part of his dress should have been carried down
to his heels. This improvement on his kilt was suggested,
in the most polite terms, to Donald himself, by a Spanish
gentleman, who spoke a little English, and who had ascertained
that our hero was a native of Great Britain, and
whom he believed to be a man of note. To this suggestion
Donald made no other reply than by a look of the
utmost indignation and contempt. The Spanish gentleman,
whose name was Don Sebastanio, seeing that his
remark had given offence, hastened to apologise for the
liberty he had taken&mdash;assuring Donald that he meant
nothing disrespectful or insulting. This apology was just
made in time, as the irritable Celt had begun to entertain
the idea of challenging the Spaniard to mortal combat.
As it was, however, his good nature at once gave way to
the pacific overture that was made him. Seizing the
apologist by the hand, with a gripe that produced some
dismal contortions of countenance on the part of him on
whom it was inflicted&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is no harm done at all, my friend. You&#8217;ll not know
no petter, having never peen, I dare say, in our country,
or seen a heelanman pefore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Spaniard declared he never had had either of these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
happinesses, and concluded by inviting Donald to an adjoining
apartment to have some refreshment&mdash;an invitation
which Donald at once obeyed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my good sir,&rdquo; said his companion, on their
entering a sort of refectory where were a variety of tables
spread with abundance of the good things of this life and
of Madrid, &ldquo;what shall you prefer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Herself&#8217;s not fery hungry, but a little thirsty,&rdquo; said
Donald, flinging himself down on a seat in a free-and-easy
way, with his legs astride, so as to allow free suspension to
his huge goat-skin purse, and doffing his bonnet, and
wiping the perspiration from his forehead&mdash;&ldquo;Herself&#8217;s no
fery hungry, but a little thirsty; and she&#8217;ll teukit, if you
please, a fery small drop of whisky and water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Spaniard was nonplussed. He had never even
heard of whisky in his life, and was therefore greatly at a
loss to understand what sort of liquor his friend meant.
Donald, perceiving his difficulty, and guessing that it was
of the same nature with the one which he had already
experienced, hastily transmuted his demand for whisky
into one for brandy, which was immediately supplied him,
when Donald, pouring into a rummer a quantity equal to at
least six glasses, filled up with water, and drank the whole
off, to the inexpressible amazement of his companion, who,
however, although he looked unutterable things at the
enormous draught, was much too polite to say anything.</p>

<p>Thus primed a second time, Donald, seeing his new
friend engaged with some ladies who had unexpectedly
joined him, returned alone to the dancing apartment,
which he entered with a whoop of encouragement to the
performers that startled every one present, and for an
instant arrested the motions of the dancers, who could
not comprehend the meaning of his uncouth cries. Regardless
of this effect of his interference in the proceedings
of the evening, Donald, with a countenance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
beaming with hilarity, and eyes sparkling with wild and
reckless glee, took up a conspicuous position in the room,
and from thence commenced edifying the dancers by a
series of short abrupt shouts or yells, accompanied by a
vigorous clapping of his hands, at once to intimate his
satisfaction with the performances, and to encourage the
performers themselves to further exertions. Getting gradually,
however, too much into the spirit of the thing to
be content with being merely an onlooker, Donald all at
once capered into the middle of the floor, snapping his
fingers and thumbs, and calling out to the musicians to
strike up &ldquo;Caber Feigh;&rdquo; and, without waiting to hear
whether his call was obeyed, he commenced a vigorous
exhibition of the highland fling, to the great amazement
of the bystanders, who, instantly abandoning their own
pursuits, crowded around him to witness this to them
most extraordinary performance. Thus occupied, and
thus situated&mdash;the centre of a &ldquo;glittering ring&rdquo;&mdash;Donald
continued to execute with unabated energy the various
strongly-marked movements of his national dance, amidst
the loud applauses of the surrounding spectators. On concluding&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oich, oich!&rdquo; exclaimed Donald, out of breath with
his exertion, and looking laughingly round on the circle
of bystanders. &ldquo;Did ever I think to dance ta heelan
fling in Madrid! Och, no, no! Never, by Shoseph!
But, I dare say, it&#8217;ll pe the first time that it was ever
danced here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From this moment Donald became a universal favourite
in the room, and the established lion of the night. Where-ever
he went he was surrounded with an admiring group,
and was overloaded with civilities of all kinds, including
frequent offers of refreshment; so that he speedily found
himself in most excellent quarters. There was, however,
one drawback in his happiness. He could get no share in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
the dancing excepting what he chose to perform solus, as
there was nothing in that way to be seen in the room in
the shape of a reel, nor was there a single tune played of
which he could make either head or tail&mdash;nothing but
&ldquo;your foreign trash, with neither spunk nor music in
them.&rdquo; Determined, however, since his highland fling
had been so much approved of, to give a specimen of the
highland reel, if he could possibly make it out, Donald,
as a first step, looked around him for a partner; and seeing
a very handsome girl seated in one of the corners of
the apartment, and apparently disengaged, he made up to
her, and, making one of his best bows, solicited the honour
of her joining him in a reel. Without understanding the
language in which she was addressed, but guessing that it
conveyed an invitation to the floor, the young lady at
once arose and curtsied an acquiescence, when Donald,
taking her gallantly by the hand, led her up to the front
of the orchestra, in order that he might bespeak the
appropriate music for the particular species of dance he
contemplated. On approaching sufficiently near to the
musicians&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fittlers,&rdquo; he shouted, at the top of his voice, &ldquo;I say,
can you&#8217;ll kive us &lsquo;Rothiemurchus&#8217; Rant,&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Trucken
Wives of Fochabers?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then turning to his partner, and flinging his arms about
her neck in an ecstasy of Highland excitation, capering
at the same time hilariously in anticipation of the coming
strain&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Them&#8217;s the tunes, my lass, for putting mettle in your heels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A scream from the lady with whom Donald was using
these unwarrantable personal liberties, and a violent
attempt on her part to escape from them, suddenly arrested
Donald&#8217;s hilarity, and excited his utmost surprise.
In the next instant he was surrounded by at least half-a-dozen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
angry cavaliers, amongst whom there was a brandishing
of swords and much violent denunciation, all
directed against Donald, and excited by his unmannerly
rudeness to a lady. It was some seconds before Donald
could comprehend the meaning of all this wrath, or
believe that he was at once the cause and the object of it.
But on this becoming plain&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, shentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I did not mean anything
wrong. No offence at all to the girl. It was just
the fashion of my country; and I&#8217;m sorry for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this apology of Donald&#8217;s, of which, of course, not a
word was understood, the only reply was a more fierce
flourishing of brands, and a greater volubility and vehemence
of abuse; the effect of which was at once to
arouse Donald&#8217;s choler, and to urge him headlong on
extremities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you&#8217;ll not have satisfaction
any other way than py the sword, py the sword you shall
have it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And instantly drawing, he stood ready to encounter at
once the whole host of his enemies. What might have
been the result of so unequal a contest, had it taken place,
we cannot tell&mdash;and this simply because no encounter did
take place. At the moment that Donald was awaiting the
onset of the foe&mdash;a proceeding, by the way, which they were
now marvellously slow in adopting, notwithstanding the
fury with which they had opened the assault, a party of
the king&#8217;s guard, with fixed bayonets, rushed into the
apartment, and bore Donald forcibly out into the street,
where they left him, with angry signs that if he attempted
to return, he would meet with still worse treatment.
Donald had prudence enough to perceive that any attempt
to resent the insult that had been offered him&mdash;seeing that
it was perpetrated by a dozen men armed with musket
and bayonet&mdash;would be madness, and therefore contented
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
himself with muttering in Gaelic some expressions of high
indignation and contempt. Having delivered himself to
this effect, he proudly adjusted his plaid, and stalked
majestically away.</p>

<p>It was now so far advanced in the morning that Donald
abandoned all idea of seeking for a bed, and resolved on
prosecuting an assiduous search for his brother. This he
accordingly commenced, and numerous were the calls at
shops, and frequent the inquiries he made for Tuncan
Gorm; but unavailing were they all. No one understood
a word of what he addressed to them; and thus, of course,
no one could give him the information he desired. It was
in vain, too, that Donald carefully scanned every sign that
he passed, to see that it did not bear the anxiously looked
for name. On none of them did it appear. They were all,
as Donald himself said, Fouros, and Beuros, and Lebranos,
and Dranos, and other outlandish and unchristian-like
names. Not a heeland or lowland shopkeeper amongst
them. No such a decent and civilized name to be met with
as Gorm, or Brolachan, or M&#699;Fadyen, or Macharuarich, or
M&#699;Cuallisky.</p>

<p>Tired and disappointed, Donald, after wandering up
and down the streets for several hours, bethought him of
adjourning to a tavern to have something to eat, and probably
something to drink also. Seeing such a house as
he wanted, he entered, and desired the landlord to furnish
him with some dinner. In a few seconds two dishes were
placed before him; but what these dishes were, Donald
could not at all make out. They resembled nothing in the
edible way he had ever seen before, and the flavour was
most alarming. Nevertheless, being pretty sharp-set, he
resolved to try them, and for this purpose drew one of the
dishes towards him, when, having peered as curiously and
cautiously into it for a few seconds as if he feared it would
leap up in his face and bite him, and curling his nose the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
while into strong disapprobation of its odour, he lifted
several spoonfuls of the black greasy mess on his plate.
At this point Donald found his courage failing him; but,
as his host stood behind his chair and was witness to all
his proceedings, he did not like either to express the
excessive disgust he was beginning to feel, nor to refuse
tasting of what was set before him. Mustering all his
remaining courage, therefore, he plunged his spoon with
desperate violence into the nauseous mess, which seemed
to Donald to be some villanous compound of garlic, rancid
oil, and dough; and raising it to his lips, shut his eyes,
and boldly thrust it into his mouth. Donald&#8217;s resolution,
however, could carry him no farther. To swallow it he
found utterly impossible, now that the horrors of both
taste and smell were full upon him. In this predicament,
Donald had no other way for it but to give back what he
had taken; and this course he instantly followed, adding a
large interest, and exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Cot! what sort of a country is this? Your drinks
is poison, and your meats is poison, and everything is
apominations apout you. Oich, oich! I wish to Cot I was
back to Eddernahulish again; for I&#8217;ll pe either poisoned
or murdered amongst you if I remain much longer here.
That&#8217;s peyond all doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And having thus expressed himself, Donald started to
his feet, and was about to leave the house without any
farther ceremony, when the landlord adroitly planted
himself between him and the door, and demanded the
reckoning. Donald did not know precisely what was
asked of him, but he guessed that it was a demand for
payment, and this demand he was determined to resist, on
the ground that what he could not eat he ought not to be
called on to pay for. Full of this resolution, and having
no doubt that he was right in his conjecture as to the
landlord&#8217;s purpose in preventing his exit&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
&ldquo;Pay for ta apominations!&rdquo; said Donald, wrathfully.
&ldquo;Pay for ta poison! It&#8217;s myself will see you at Jericho
first. Not a farthing, not one tam farthing, will I pay you
for ta trash. So stand out of the way, my friend, pefore
worse comes of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Saying this, Donald advanced to the door, and seizing
its guardian by the breast, laid him gently on his back on
the floor, and stepping over his prostrate body, walked
deliberately out of the house, without further interruption,
mine host not thinking it advisable to excite further
the choler of so dangerous a customer, and one who had
just given him so satisfactory a specimen of his personal
prowess. Another day had now nearly passed away, and
Donald was still as far, to all appearance, from finding the
object of his search as ever he had been. He was, moreover,
now both hungry and thirsty; but these were evils
which he soon after succeeded in obviating for the time,
by a more successful foray than the last. Going into
another house of entertainment, he contrived to make a
demand for bread and cheese intelligible&mdash;articles which
he had specially condescended on, that there might be &ldquo;no
mistake;&rdquo; and with these and a pretty capacious measure
of brandy, he managed to effect a very tolerable passover.
Before leaving this house, Donald made once more the
already oft but vainly-repeated inquiry, whether he knew
(he was addressing his landlord) where one Duncan Gorm
stopped. It did not now surprise Donald to find that his
inquiry was not understood; but it did both surprise and
delight him when his host, who had abruptly left the room
for an instant, returned with a person who spoke very
tolerable English. This man was a muleteer, and had resided
for some years in London, in the service of the Spanish
ambassador. His name&mdash;a most convenient one for Donald
to pronounce&mdash;was Mendoza Ambrosius. On being introduced
to this personage, Donald expressed the utmost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
delight at finding in him one who spoke a Christian
language, as he called it; and, in the joy of his heart with
his good fortune, ordered in a jorum of brandy for the
entertainment of himself and Mr. Ambrosius. The liquor
being brought, and several horns of it discussed, Donald
and his new friend got as thick as &ldquo;ben&#8217; leather.&rdquo; And
on this happy understanding being established, the former
began to detail, at all the length it would admit of, the
purpose of his visit to Madrid, and the occurrences that
had befallen him since his arrival; prefacing these particulars
with a sketch of his history, and some account of
the place of his nativity; and concluding the whole by
asking his companion if he could in any way assist him to
find his brother, Duncan Gorm.</p>

<p>The muleteer replied, in the best English he could
command, that he did not know the particular person
inquired after, but that he knew the residences of two or
three natives of Britain, some of whom, he thought it
probable, might be acquainted with his brother; and that
he would have much pleasure in conducting him to these
persons, for the purpose of ascertaining this. Donald
thanked his friend for his civility; and, in a short time
thereafter, the brandy having been finished in the interim,
the two set out together on their expedition of inquiry.
It was a clear, moonlight night; but, although it was so,
and the hour what would be considered in this country
early, the streets were nearly deserted, and as lonely and
quiet as if Madrid were a city of the dead. This stillness
had the effect of making the smallest sound audible even
at a great distance, and to this stillness it was owing that
Donald and his friend suddenly heard, soon after they had
set out, the clashing of swords, intermingled with occasional
shouts, at a remote part of the street they were
traversing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s tat?&rdquo; exclaimed Donald, stopping abruptly,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
and cocking his ears at the well-known sound of clashing
steel. His companion, accustomed to such occurrences,
replied, with an air of indifference, that it was merely
some street brawl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;ll pe these tam vinekar drinkers again,&rdquo; said Donald,
with a lively recollection of the assault that had been made
upon himself; &ldquo;maybe some poor shentleman&#8217;s in distress.
Let us go and see, my tear sir.&rdquo; To this proposal, the
muleteer, with a proper sense of the folly of throwing himself
in the way of mischief unnecessarily, would at first
by no means accede; but, on being urged by Donald,
agreed to move on a little with him towards the scene
of conflict. This proceeding soon brought them near
enough to the combatants to perceive that Donald&#8217;s
random conjecture had not been far wrong, by discovering
to them one person, who, with his back to the wall, was
bravely defending himself against no fewer than four
assailants, all being armed with swords.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did not I tell you so!&rdquo; exclaimed Donald, in great
excitation, on seeing how matters stood. &ldquo;Noo, Maister
Tozy Brozy, shoulder to shoulder, my tear, and we&#8217;ll assist
this poor shentleman.&rdquo; Saying this, Donald drew his
claymore, and rushed headlong on to the rescue, calling
on Tozy Brozy to follow him; but Tozy Brozy&#8217;s feelings
and impulses carried him in a totally different direction.
Fearing that his friend&#8217;s interference in the squabble might
have the effect of directing some of the blows his way, he
fairly took to his heels, leaving Donald to do by himself
what to himself seemed needful in the case. In the meantime,
too much engrossed by the duty before him to mind
much whether his friend followed him or not, Donald
struck boldly in, in aid of the &ldquo;shentleman in distress,&rdquo;
exclaiming, as he did so&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fair play, my tears! Fair play&#8217;s a shewel everywhere,
and I suppose here too.&rdquo; And, saying this, with one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
thundering blow that fairly split the skull of the unfortunate
wight on whom it fell in twain, Donald lessened the
number of the combatants by one. The person to whose
aid he had thus so unexpectedly and opportunely come,
seeing what an effectual ally he had got, gave a shout of
triumphant joy, and, although much exhausted by the
violence and length of his exertions in defending himself,
instantly became the assailant in his turn. Inspired with
new life and vigour, he pressed on his enemies with a fury
that compelled them to give way; and, being splendidly
seconded by Donald, whose tremendous blows were falling
with powerful effect on those against whom they were
directed, the result was, in a few seconds, the flight of the
enemy; who, in rapid succession, one after the other, took
to their heels, although not without carrying along with
them several authentic certificates of the efficiency of
Donald&#8217;s claymore.</p>

<p>On the retreat of the bravos&mdash;for such they were&mdash;the
person whom Donald had so efficiently served in his hour
of need, flew towards him, and, taking him in his arms,
poured out a torrent of thanks for the prompt and gallant
aid he had afforded him. But, as these thanks were expressed
in Spanish, they were lost on him to whom they
were addressed. Not so, however, the indications of gratitude
evinced in the acts by which they were accompanied.
These Donald perfectly understood, and replied to them
as if their sense had been conveyed to him in a language
which he comprehended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No thanks at all, my tear sir. A Heelantman will
always assist a freend where a few plows will do him goot.
You would shust do the same to me, I&#8217;m sure. But,&rdquo;
added Donald, as he sheathed his most serviceable weapon,
&ldquo;this is the tam place for fechtin&#8217; I have ever seen. I
thocht our own Heelants pad enough, but this is ten times
worse, py Shoseph! I have no peen more than four-and-twenty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
hours in Ma-a-treed, and I&#8217;ll have peen in tree
fecht already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>More of this speech was understood by the person to
whom it was addressed, than might have been expected
under all these circumstances. This person was a Spanish
gentleman of rank and great wealth, of the name of Don
Antonio Nunnez, whose acquirements included a very
competent knowledge of the English language, which,
although he spoke it but indifferently, he understood very
well. Yet it certainly did require all his knowledge of it,
to recognise it in the shape in which Donald presented it
to him. This, however, to a certain extent, he did, and, in
English, now repeated his sense of the important obligation
Donald had conferred on him. But it was not to
words alone that the grateful and generous Spaniard
meant to confine his acknowledgments of the service that
had been rendered him. Having ascertained that Donald
was a perfect stranger in the city, he insisted on his going
home with him, and remaining with him during his stay
in Madrid, and further requesting that he would seek at
his hands, and no other&#8217;s, any service or obligation, of
whatever nature it might be, of which he should stand in
need during his stay.</p>

<p>To these generous proffers, Donald replied, that the
greatest service that could be done him was to inform him
where he could find his brother, Duncan Gorm. Don
Antonio first expressed surprise to learn that Donald had
a brother in Madrid, and then his sorrow that he did not
know, nor had ever heard of such a person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&#8217;ll keep a public,&rdquo; said Donald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that, my friend?&rdquo; inquired Don Antonio.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sell a shill, to be sure&mdash;I&#8217;ll thocht everybody know that,&rdquo;
said Donald, a good deal surprised at the other&#8217;s ignorance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shill? shill?&rdquo; repeated the Spaniard&mdash;&ldquo;and pray, my
friend, what is a shill?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
&ldquo;Cot pless me! don&#8217;t you&#8217;ll know what a shill is?&rdquo; rejoined
Donald, with increased amazement. &ldquo;If you&#8217;ll
come with me to Eddernahulish, I&#8217;ll show you what a shill
is, and help you to drink it too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, my friend,&rdquo; said Don Antonio. &ldquo;I&#8217;ll get
an explanation of what a &lsquo;shill&rsquo; is from you afterwards;
but, in the meantime, you&#8217;ll come with me, if you please,
as I am anxious to introduce you to some friends at home!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Saying this, he took Donald&#8217;s arm, in order to act as
his conductor, and, after leading him through two or three
streets, brought him to the door of a very large and handsome
house. Don Antonio having knocked at this door,
it was immediately opened by a servant in splendid livery,
who, on recognising his master&mdash;for such was Donald&#8217;s
friend&mdash;instantly stepped aside, and respectfully admitted
the pair. In the vestibule, or passage, which was exceedingly
magnificent, were a number of other serving men in
rich liveries, who drew themselves up on either side, in
order to allow their master and his friend to pass; and
much did they marvel at the strange garb in which that
friend appeared. Don Antonio now conducted Donald up
the broad marbled staircase, splendidly illuminated with a
variety of elegant lamps, in which the vestibule terminated;
and, on reaching the top of the first flight, ushered
him into a large and gorgeously-furnished apartment, in
which were two ladies dressed in deep mourning. To
these ladies, one of whom was the mother, the other the
sister of Don Antonio, the latter introduced his amazed
and awe-stricken companion, as a person to whom he was
indebted for his life. He then explained to his relations
what had occurred, and did not fail to give Donald&#8217;s
promptitude and courage a due share of his laudations.
With a gratitude not less earnest than his own had been,
the mother and sister of Don Antonio took Donald by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
hand; the one taking the right, and the other the left,
and, looking in his face, with an expression of the utmost
kindness, thanked him for the great obligation he had
conferred on them. These thanks were expressed in
Spanish; but, on Don Antonio&#8217;s mentioning that Donald
was a native of Britain, and that he did not, as he
rather thought, understand the Spanish language, his
sister, a beautiful girl of one or two-and-twenty, repeated
them, in somewhat minced, but perfectly intelligible
English. Great as Donald&#8217;s perturbation was at finding
himself so suddenly and unexpectedly placed in a situation
so much at variance with anything he had been accustomed
to, it did not prevent him marking, in a very special
manner, the dark sparkling eyes and rich sable tresses of
Donna Nunnez, the name of Don Antonio&#8217;s sister. Nor,
we must add, did the former look with utter indifference
on the manly form, so advantageously set off as it was by
his native dress, of Donald Gorm. But of this anon. In
a short time after, a supper, corresponding in elegance and
splendour to all the other elegances and splendours of this
lordly mansion, was served up; and, on its conclusion,
Donald was conducted, by Don Antonio himself, to a
sleeping apartment, furnished with the same magnificence
that prevailed throughout the whole house. Having
ushered him into his apartment, Donald&#8217;s host bade him a
kind good-night, and left him to his repose.</p>

<p>What Donald&#8217;s feelings were on finding himself thus so
superbly quartered, now that he had time to think on the
subject, and could do so unrestrained by the presence of
any one, we do not precisely know; but, if one might
have judged by the under-breath exclamations in which
he indulged, and by the looks of amazement and inquiry
which he cast around him, from time to time, on the
splendours by which he was surrounded, especially on the
gorgeous bed, with its gilt canopy and curtains of crimson
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
silk, which was destined for his night&#8217;s resting-place, these
feelings would appear to have been, after all, fully more
perplexing than pleasing. It was, in truth, just too much
of a good thing; and Donald felt it to be so. But still
the whole had a smack of good fortune about it that was
very far from being disagreeable, and that certainly had
the effect of reconciling Donald to the little discordance
between former habits and present circumstances, which
his position for the time excited.</p>

<p>While at breakfast on the following morning with Don
Antonio and his mother and sister, the first asked Donald
if he had any particular ties in his own country that would
imperatively demand his return home; and on Donald&#8217;s
replying that there were none, Don Antonio immediately
inquired whether he would accept a commission in the
King of Spain&#8217;s body-guards:&mdash;&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if
you will, I have, I believe, influence enough to procure it
for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Donald said he had no objection in the world to try it
for a year or two, at any rate&mdash;only he would like to consult
his &ldquo;broder Tuncan&rdquo; first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; said Don Antonio; &ldquo;I promised to assist
you in finding out your relative&mdash;and I shall do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As good as his word in this particular, and a great deal
better in many others in which Donald was interested,
Don Antonio instantly set an inquiry on foot, which, in
less than two hours, brought the brothers together. The
sequel of our story, although containing the very essence
of Donald&#8217;s good fortune, is soon told. His brother,
highly approving of his accepting the commission offered
to him, Don Antonio lost no time in procuring him that
appointment; and in less than three weeks from his arrival
in Madrid, Donald Gorm figured as a captain in the King
of Spain&#8217;s body-guards, in which service he ultimately
attained the rank of colonel, together with a title of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
honour, which enabled him to ask, without fear of giving
offence, and to obtain, the hand of Donna Nunnez, with a
dowry second to that of no fair damsel in Spain. Donald
never again returned to Eddernahulish, but continued in
the country of his adoption till his death; and in that
country some of his descendants to this hour bear amongst
the proudest names of which it can boast.</p>

<h2>THE SURGEON&#8217;S TALES.</h2>

<h3>THE CURED INGRATE.</h3>


<p>Every person who has studied, even in the most cursory
manner, the checkered page of human life, must have observed
that there are in continual operation through mankind
some great secret moral agents, the powers of which
are exerted within the heart, and beyond the reach of the
consciousness or observation of the individual himself who
is subject to their influence. There is a steadfastness of
virtue in some high-minded men, which enables them to
resist the insidious temptations of the bad demon; there
is also a stern stability of vice often found in the unfortunate
outlaw, which disregards, for a time, the voice of
conscience, and spurns the whispered wooing of the good
principle, &ldquo;charm it never so wisely;&rdquo; yet the real confessions
of the hearts of those individuals would show
traces enough of the agency of the unseen power to prove
their want of title to an exception from the general rule
which includes all the sons of Adam. We find, also, that
extraordinary moral effects are often produced, in a dark
and mysterious manner, from physical causes: every medical
man has the power of recording, if he has had the
faculty of observing, changes in the minds, principles, and
feelings of patients who have come through the fiery ordeal
of a terrible disease, altogether unaccountable on any rules
of philosophy yet discovered.</p>

<p>Not many years ago, a well-dressed young woman called
one evening upon me, and stated that her lady, whose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
name, she said, would be communicated by herself, had
been ill for some days, and wished me to visit her privately.
I asked her when she required my attendance; and got
for answer, that she, the messenger, would conduct me to
the residence of the patient, if it was convenient for me to
go at that time. I was disengaged, and agreed to accompany
the young woman as soon as I had given directions
to my assistant regarding the preparation of some medicines
which required the application of chemical rules.
To be ingenuous, I was a little curious to know the secret
of this private call; for that there was a secret about it
was plain, from the words, and especially the manner, of
the young woman, who spoke mysteriously, and did not
seem to wish any questions put to her on the subject of
her mission. The night was dark, but the considerate
messenger had provided a lantern; and, to anticipate my
scruples, she said that the distance we had to go would
not render it necessary for me to take my carriage&mdash;a five-minutes&#8217;
walk being sufficient to take us to our destination.</p>

<p>Resigning myself to the guidance of my conductress, I
requested her to lead the way, and we proceeded along
two neighbouring streets of considerable length, and then
turned up to&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;Square&mdash;a place where the rich and
fashionable part of the inhabitants of the town have their
residences. At the mouth of a coach entry, which ran
along the gable of a large house, and apparently led to the
back offices connected with the residence, the young woman
stopped, and whispered to me to take care of my
feet, as she was to use the liberty of leading me along a
meuse lane to a back entrance, through which I was to be
conducted into the chamber of the sick lady. I obeyed
her directions; and, keeping close behind her, was led
along the lane, and through several turns and windings
which I feared I might not again be able to trace without
a guide, until we came to a back door, when the young
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
woman&mdash;begging my pardon for her forwardness&mdash;took
hold of my hand, and led me along a dark passage, then
up a stair, then along another passage, which was lighted
by some wax tapers placed in recesses in the wall; at the
end of which, she softly opened a door, and ushered me
into a very large bedroom, the magnificence of which was
only partly revealed to me by a small lamp filled with
aromatic oil, whose fragrance filled the apartment. The
young woman walked quickly forward to a bed, hung
with light green silk damask curtains fringed with yellow,
and luxuriously ornamented with a superfluity of gilding;
and, drawing aside the curtains, she whispered a few words
into the ear of some one lying there, apparently in distress;
then hurried out of the room, leaving me standing on the
floor, without introduction or explanation.</p>

<p>The novelty of my position deprived me for a moment
of my self-possession, and I stood stationary in the middle
of the room, deliberating upon whether I should call back
my conductress, and ask from her some explanation, or
proceed forward to the couch, where, no doubt, my services
were required; but my hesitation was soon resolved, by
the extraordinary appearance of an Indian-coloured female
countenance, much emaciated, and lighted up with two
bright orbs, occupying the interstice between the curtains,
and beckoning on me, apparently with a painful effort,
forward. I obeyed, and, throwing open the large folds of
damask, had as full a view of my extraordinary patient as
the light that emanated from the perfumed lamp, and
shone feebly on her dark countenance, would permit. She
beckoned to me to take a chair, which stood by the side
of the bed; and, having complied with her mute request,
I begged to know what was the complaint under which she
laboured, that I might endeavour to yield her such relief
as was in the power of our professional art. I thus limited
my question to the nature of her disease, in the expectation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
that she herself would clear up the mystery which hung
around the manner in which I was called, and introduced
to so extraordinary a scene as that which was now before
me. Her great weakness seemed to require some composure,
and a collecting of her scattered and reduced energies,
before she could answer my simple question. I now
observed more perfectly than I had yet done the character
and style of the room into which I had been introduced&mdash;its
furniture, ornaments, and luxuries; and, above
all, the extraordinary, foreign-looking invalid who seemed
to be the mistress of so much grandeur. Though a bedroom,
the apartment seemed to have had lavished upon its
fitting-up as much money as is often expended on a lord&#8217;s
drawing-room&mdash;the bed itself, the wardrobes, pier-glasses,
toilets, and dressing-cases, being of the most elaborate
workmanship and costly character&mdash;the pictures numerous,
and magnificently framed; while on all sides were to be
seen foreign ornaments, chiefly Chinese and Indian, of
brilliant appearance, and devoted to purposes and uses of
refined luxury of which I could form no adequate conception.
On a small table, near the bed, there was a multiplicity
of boxes, vials, trinkets, and bijouterie of all kinds;
and fragrant mixtures, intended to perfume the apartment,
were exposed in various quarters, and even scattered exuberantly
on spread covers of satin, with a view to their
yielding their sweets more freely, and filling all the corners
of the room. In full contrast with all this array of grandeur
and luxury, lay the strange-looking individual already
mentioned, on the gorgeous bed. She was apparently an
East Indian; and, though possessed of comely features,
she was even darker than the fair Hindoos we often see in
this country. The sickness under which she laboured,
and which appeared to be very severe, had rendered her
thin and cadaverous-looking&mdash;making the balls of her
brilliant eyes assume the appearance of being protruded,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
and imparting to all her features a sharp, prominent aspect,
the very reverse of the natural Indian type; yet, true to
her sex and the manners of her country, she was splendidly
decorated, even in this state of dishabille and distress; the
coverlet being of rich Indian manufacture, and resplendent
with the dyes of the East&mdash;her gown and cap decorated
with costly needlework&mdash;her fingers covered with a profusion
of rings, while a cambric handkerchief, richly embroidered,
in her right hand, had partly enveloped in its
folds a large golden vinegarette, set profusely with glittering
gems.</p>

<p>The rapid survey which enabled me to gather this
general estimate of what was presented to me, was nearly
completed before the invalid had collected strength enough
to answer my question; and she was just beginning to
speak&mdash;having as yet pronounced only a few inarticulate
syllables&mdash;when she was interrupted by the entrance of the
same young woman who had acted as my conductress, and
who now exhibited a manner the very opposite of the soft,
quiet, slipping nature of her former carriage. The suddenness,
and even impetuosity of her entry, was inconsistent
with the character of nurse to a lady in so distressed a
condition as that of her apparent mistress; but her subsequent
conduct was much more incomprehensible and extraordinary;
for, without speaking and without stopping,
she rushed forward, and, taking me by the arm, hurried
me away through the door by which I had entered, along
the lighted passage, down the stair, and never stopped
until she landed me on the threshold of the back-door by
which I entered the house. At this time I heard the bell
of, as I thought, the fore or street door of the house ringing
violently; and my conductress, without saying a word,
ran away as fast as the darkness would permit, leaving me,
perplexed and confounded at what I had seen and heard,
to find my way home in the best way I could.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
In my professional capacity I had not been accustomed
to any mysterious or secret practice of our art, which,
being exercised ostensibly and in reality for the benefit of
mankind, requires no cloak to cover its operations; and,
though I was curious to know the secret of such incomprehensible
proceedings, I felt no admiration of, or relish for
adventures so unsuited to the life and manners of a sober,
practical man. One thing, however, was clear, and seemed
sufficient to reconcile my practical, every-day notions of
life with this mysterious negotiation, and even to solve the
doubt I entertained whether I should again trust myself
as a party to the devices of secrecy&mdash;and that was, that
the individual I had been thus called to see professionally
was in such a condition of body as required urgently the
administrations of a medical practitioner. On the following
day, I resolved upon making some inquiries, with a
view to ascertain who and what the individual was that
occupied the house to which I had been introduced, and
which, upon a survey in daylight, I could have no difficulty
in tracing; but I happened to be too much occupied to be
able to put my purpose into execution; and was thus
obliged to remain, during the day, in a state of suspense
and ignorance of the secret involved in my previous night&#8217;s
professional adventure. In the evening, however, and
about the same hour at which the messenger called for me
on the previous occasion, the same individual waited on
me, with an apology for the apparently unceremonious
treatment I had received, and which, she said, would be
explained to my satisfaction; and a renewed request that
I would again accompany her to the same house, and on
the same errand. I told the messenger that I bore no
great love to these secret adventures, but that I would
consent, on this occasion, to make a sacrifice of my principles
and feelings to the hope of being able to be of some
use, in a professional way, to the distressed lady I had seen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
on the previous occasion, whose situation, so far as I could
judge from appearances, was not far removed from the
extremity of danger. I again, accordingly, committed myself
to the guidance of the young woman; and, after a
repetition of the windings and evolutions of the previous
visit, soon found myself again seated in the chair that stood
by the gorgeous bed of the strange invalid. Everything
seemed to be in the same situation as before: the lamp
gave out its weak light, the perfumes exhaled their sweets,
and the distressed lady exhibited the same strange contrast
between her reduced sickly condition and the superb
finery of her dishabille.</p>

<p>I had not been long seated, when she struggled to inform
me, in a very weak voice, that she was much beholden to
me for my attention, and grieved for the unceremonious
treatment I had received on my last visit. I replied, that
I laid my account with much greater personal inconvenience,
in the pursuit of my profession, than any to which
she had subjected or could subject me&mdash;all such considerations
being, in my apprehension, of small importance in
comparison with the good we had often the power of
administering to individuals in distress; and begged to
know the nature of the complaint under which she too
evidently laboured, that I might endeavour to ameliorate
her sufferings, and restore her to that health without
which the riches she apparently was mistress of, could be
of small avail in rendering her happy. She appeared
grateful for the sentiments I expressed; and proceeded to
tell me, still with the same struggling difficulty of utterance,
arising from her extreme weakness, that she was the wife
of Colonel P&mdash;&mdash;, the proprietor of the mansion into which
I had been thus secretly introduced, for reasons she would
explain in the course of her narrative. She had been
married to her husband, she proceeded, in the East Indies,
of which country she was a native; and, having succeeded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
to a large fortune on the death of her father, had given it
all freely without bond, contract, or settlement, to her
husband, whom she loved, honoured, and worshipped, beyond
all earthly beings, and with an ardour which had never
abated from the first moment she had become his wife.
Nor was the affection limited to one side of the house; for
she was more than satisfied that her lord and master&mdash;grateful,
no doubt, for the rank, honour, riches, and independence
to which she had raised him&mdash;loved her with an
affection at least equal to her own. But all these advantages
(and she sighed deeply as she proceeded) were of
little consequence to the production of happiness, if the
greatest of all blessings, health, were denied to the possessor;
and that too she had enjoyed, uninterruptedly, until
about a month previously, when she was seized with an
illness, the nature of which she could not comprehend;
and which, notwithstanding all the anxious efforts of her
husband, had continued unabated to that hour.</p>

<p>She paused, and seemed much exhausted by the struggle
she made to let me thus far into her history. The concluding
part of her statement, combined with the still
unexplained secrecy of my call, surprised me, and defied
my powers of penetration. This lady had been dangerously
ill for a month, during all which time no medical
man had been called to her aid; and even now, when her
body was attenuated, and her strength exhausted to the
uttermost, professional assistance had been introduced into
the house by stealth, as if it were against the laws to ameliorate
human sufferings by curing diseases. This apparent
anomaly in human conduct struck me so forcibly that
I could not refrain from asking the patient, even before
she recovered strength enough to answer me, what was her
or her husband&#8217;s reason for not calling assistance; and why
that assistance was at last requested under the cloud of
secrecy and apprehension.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
&ldquo;That I intended to explain to you,&rdquo; she said, after a
pause. &ldquo;When I felt myself ill (and my complaint commenced
by excruciating pains in my stomach, accompanied
with vomiting), I told my husband that I feared it
would be necessary to call a doctor; but, ah, sir! the
very thought of the necessity of medical aid to the object
of so much love and tenderness, put him almost frantic.
He confessed that it was a weakness; but declared his
inability to conquer it. Yet, alas! his unremitting kindness
has not diminished my disease. Though I have taken
everything his solicitude has suggested and offered to me,
my pains still continue, my appetite is entirely gone, and
the weakness of my body has approached that of the helpless
infant. Three days ago I thought I would have
breathed my last; and parting thoughts of my native
country, and the dear friends I left there to follow the
fortunes of a dearer stranger, passed through my mind
with the feeling of a long and everlasting farewell. My
husband wept over me, and prayed for my recovery; but
he could not think me so ill as to make the call of the
doctor imperative; and I did not press a subject which I
saw was painful to him. No, sir, I would rather have
died than have produced in him the slightest uneasiness;
and my object in calling you in the secret manner you
have witnessed, was simply to avoid causing to him the
pain of thinking that my illness was so great as to render
your services absolutely necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The communication I now heard, which was spoken in
broken sentences and after considerable pauses, in place of
clearing up my difficulty, increased it, and added to my
surprise. Some light was, no doubt, thrown on the cause
which produced the secret manner of my visitation; but
every other circumstance attending the unfortunate lady&#8217;s
case was merged in deeper gloom and mystery. The
circumstance of a husband who loved his wife refusing to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
call professional assistance, appeared to be not less extraordinary
than the reason assigned for it&mdash;even with all the
allowances, justified by a very prevailing prejudice, in
some weak minds, against the extremity of calling a
doctor. I had heard something of Colonel P&mdash;&mdash;; that
he was considered to be immensely rich, and known to be
a deep gambler, but I never understood that he was a
victim of weak or imaginary fears, and I was therefore
inclined to doubt the truth of the reason assigned by the
unsuspecting invalid, for the scrupulous delicacy of her
husband&#8217;s affection and solicitude. I pondered for a moment,
and soon perceived that the nature of her complaint,
and the kind of restoratives or medicines she might have
been receiving, would, in all likelihood, yield me more
information on the subject of my difficulty than I could
procure from her broken sentences, which, at the best,
only expressed the sentiments of a mind clouded with the
prejudice of a devoted love and unbounded credulity. I
proceeded, therefore, to ascertain the nature of her complaint;
and soon discovered that the seat of it was, as she
had said, in the region of the stomach, which not only
produced to her great pain internally, but felt sore on the
application of external pressure on the <em>pr&aelig;cordia</em>. Other
symptoms of a disease in this principal organ were present:
such as fits of painful vomiting after attempting to
eat, her great emaciation, anxiety of countenance, thirst,
restlessness, and debility; and, in ordinary circumstances,
I would have been inclined to conclude that she laboured
under some species of what we denominate <em>gastritis</em>, or
inflammation of the stomach, though I could not account
for such a disease not having been resolved and ended in
much shorter time than the period which embraced her
sufferings.</p>

<p>I next proceeded to ascertain what she had been taking
in the form of medicaments; and discovered that her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
husband, proceeding on the idea that her stomach laboured
under weakness and required some tonic medicine,
had administered to her, on several occasions, what we
term <em>limatura ferri</em> (iron filings)&mdash;a remedy for cases of
dyspepsia and bad stomachs, but not suited to the inflammatory
disorders of the kind under which she was suffering.
I asked her if she had any of the medicine lying by
her, and she replied, with simplicity, that her husband
generally took charge of it himself; but that he had that
evening laid a small paper, containing a portion of it, on
the top of a side-table, until he administered to her the
dose she was in the habit of receiving, and had gone away
without laying it past, according to his custom. I took
up the paper, examined it, and found, according to the
rapid investigation I bestowed on it, without the aid of
any tests, that it possessed all the appearances of the genuine
medicine. I, however, took the precaution of emptying
a small portion of it into another paper, and slipping
it into my pocket unobserved by the patient. I then told
her that I thought she should discontinue the use of the
powder, which was entirely unsuited to her ailment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a cruel advice, sir,&rdquo; she cried, in a tone of
great excitement. &ldquo;How can I discontinue a medicine
offered to me by the hands of a husband, without being
able to give any reason for rejecting his kindness? I
tremble to think of repaying all the attentions of that dear
man with ingratitude, and wounding his sensibility by
rejecting this testimony of his solicitude and affection. I
cannot&mdash;I feel I cannot. The grief I would thereby produce
to him would be reflected, by sympathy, on this
weak frame, which is unable to struggle much longer
with the pains of flesh alone, far less with the additional
anguish of a wounded mind, grieved to death at causing
sorrow to the man I so dearly love. Do not, oh! do not,
sir, make me an ingrate.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
I was struck with the devotion of this gentle being,
who actually trembled at the idea of producing uneasiness
to the man whom she had raised to affluence, and who yet
would not allow her the benefit of a doctor in her distress;
but, while I was pleased with this exhibition of a feature
in the female character I had never before seen so strongly
developed, though I had read and heard much of the fidelity
and affection of the women of the east, I was much
chagrined at the idea that so fair and beautiful a virtue
would probably prevent me from doing anything effectual
for a creature who, independently of her distance from her
country, had so many other claims on my sympathy. I
told her that I feared I could be of little service to her if
she could not resolve upon discontinuing her husband&#8217;s
medicine; and tried to impress upon her the necessity of
conforming to my advice, if she wished to make herself
well&mdash;the best mode, assuredly, of making her husband
happy; but she replied that she expected I would have
been able to give her something to restore her to health
independently of what she got from her husband&mdash;a result
she wished above all things, as she sighed for the opportunity
of delighting him, by attributing to his medicines
and care her restoration and happiness. I replied that
that was impossible&mdash;a statement that stung her with disappointment
and pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will take my beloved&#8217;s medicines, and die!&rdquo;
she cried, with a low struggling voice&mdash;resigning herself
to the power of her weakness.</p>

<p>This extraordinary resolution of a female devotee put
me in mind of the immolating custom of her countrywomen,
called the <em>suttee</em>. It was a complete <em>ultima ratio</em>,
and put all my remedial plans at fault in an instant. Her
extreme weakness, or her devoted resolution, prevented
her from speaking, and I sat by her bedside totally at a
loss what to do, whether to persevere in my attempt to get
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
her to renounce her husband&#8217;s medicine and to conform to
my prescriptions, or to leave her to the fate she seemed to
court. I put several more questions to her, but received
no other answer than a wave of the hand&mdash;a plain token
of her wish that I should leave her to the tender mercies
of her husband. I had now no alternative; and, rising, I
bowed to her, and took my leave. I had some difficulty
in finding my way out of the house; but, after several
ineffectual turns through wrong passages, I reached the
door through which I had entered, and returned home.</p>

<p>The extraordinary scene I had witnessed engaged my
attention during the evening, but all my efforts at clearing
up the mystery that enveloped the proceedings of these
individuals were met by difficulties which for a time
seemed insuperable. I sat cogitating and recogitating
various theories and probabilities, and had several times
examined the iron powder, which, for better observation,
I had scattered on a sheet of white paper that lay on my
table. My intention was to test it, and I waited the
incoming of my assistant to aid me in my experiment. As
I looked at it at intervals between my trains of thought, I
was struck with a kind of glittering appearance it exhibited,
and which was more observable when it caught my
eye obliquely and collaterally, during the partial suspension
of my perception by my cogitations. Roused by this
circumstance, I proceeded instantly to a more minute investigation;
and having, by means of a magnet, removed
all the particles of iron, what was my surprise to find a
residuum of triturated glass&mdash;one of the most searching
and insidious poisons known in toxicology. Good God!
what were my thoughts and feelings when the first flash
of this discovery flared upon my mind&mdash;solving, in an
instant, by the intensity of its painful light, all my doubts,
and realizing all my suspicions. Every circumstance of
this mysterious affair stood now revealed in clear relief&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
dark scheme of murder, more revolting in its features than
any recorded in the malefactor&#8217;s journal, was illumined
and exposed by a light which exhibited not only the workings
of the design itself, but the reason which led to its
perpetration. This man had married the confiding and
devoted foreigner for the sake of her immense wealth,
which raised him in an instant from mediocrity to magnificence;
and, having attained the object of his ambition,
he had resolved&mdash;with a view to the concealment of the
means whereby he effected his purpose, and regardless of
the sacred obligation of gratitude he owed to her who had
left her country, her relations, and friends, to trust herself
to his protection and love&mdash;to immolate the faithful, kind-hearted,
and affectionate creature, by a cruel and protracted
murder. In her own country the cowardly wretch
could not have braved the vengeance of her countrymen;
but, in a distant land, where few might be expected to
stand up for the rights of the injured foreigner, he had
thought he might execute his scheme with secrecy and
success. But now it was discovered! By one of those
extraordinary detached traces of the finger of the Almighty,
exposed to the convicting power of divine intellect,
it was discovered!</p>

<p>The great excitement produced in my mind by this
miraculous discovery prevented me for some time from
calmly deliberating on the steps I ought to pursue, with
the view of saving the poor foreigner from the designs of
her murderer. The picture of the devoted being lying,
like a queen, in the midst of the wealth she had brought
to her husband, and trembling at the very thought of
rejecting his poison, for fear of giving him the slightest
pain&mdash;yet on the very point of being sacrificed; her wealth,
love, confidence, and gentleness, repaid by death, and her
body consigned, unlamented by friends&mdash;who might never
hear of her fate&mdash;to foreign dust, rose continually on my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
imagination, and interested my feelings to a degree incompatible
with the exercise of a calm judgment. In proportion
as my emotion subsided, the difficulty of my situation
appeared to increase. I was, apparently, the only person
who knew anything of this extraordinary purpose, and I
saw the imprudence of taking upon myself the total responsibility
of a report to the public authorities in a case where
the chances of conviction would be diminished to nothing
by the determination of the victim to save her destroyer,
whom she never would believe guilty, and by the want of
evidence of a direct nature that the powder I had tested
was truly destined for her reception; while, in the event
of an impeachment and acquittal of the culprit, I would
be exposed to his vengeance, and his poor wife would be
for ever subjected to his tyranny and oppression. On the
other hand, I was at a loss to know how I could again get
access to the sick victim, whom I had left without being
requested to repeat my visit; and, even if that could be
accomplished, I had many doubts whether she would pay
the slightest attention or regard to my statement, that her
husband, whom she seemed to prefer to her own divine
Brama, designed to poison her. Yet it was clear that the
poor victim behoved to be saved, in some way, from the
dreadful fate which impended over her; and the necessity
of some steps being taken with rapidity and efficacy,
behoved to resolve scruples and doubts which otherwise
might have been considered worthy of longer time and
consideration.</p>

<p>Next day I found I had made little progress in coming
to a resolution what step to pursue, yet every hour and
minute that passed reproached me with cruelty, and my
imagination brought continually before my eyes the poor
victim swallowing the stated periodical quota of her death-drug.
I could have no rest or peace of mind till something
was done, at least to the extent of putting her on her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
guard against the schemes of her cruel destroyer; and,
after all my cogitations, resolutions, and schemes, I found
myself compelled to rest satisfied with seeing her, laying
before her the true nature of her danger, and leaving to
the operation of the instinctive principle of self-preservation
the working out of her ultimate safety. At the same
hour of the evening at which my former visit was made, I
repaired to the back entrance of the large mansion, and,
upon rapping at the door, was fortunate enough to be
answered by the young woman who acted formerly as my
guide. She led me, at my request, instantly to the sickroom
of her lady, who, having immediately before been
seized with an attack of vomiting, was lying in a state of
exhaustion approaching to the inanity of death. I spoke
to her, and she languidly opened her eyes. I saw no prospect
of being able to impress upon her comatose mind the
awful truth I had come to communicate; yet I had no
alternative but to make the attempt; and I accordingly
proceeded, with as few words as possible, and in a tone of
voice suited to the lethargic state of her mind and senses,
to inform her that the medicines she was getting from the
hands of her husband were fraught with deadly poison,
which was alone the cause of all her sufferings and agonies,
and would soon be the means of a painful death. These
words I spoke slowly and impressively, and watched the
effect of them with anxiety and solicitude. A convulsive
shudder passed over her, and shook her violently. She
opened her eyes, which I saw fill with tears, and fixed a
steady look on my countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>It is impossible</em>,&rdquo; she said, with a low, guttural tone,
but with much emphasis; &ldquo;and if it <em>were</em> possible, I would
still take his medicine, and die, rather than outlive the
consciousness of love and fidelity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These words she accompanied with a wave of her hand,
as if she wished me to depart. I could not get her to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
utter another syllable. I had discharged a painful duty;
and, casting a look upon her, which I verily believed would
be the last I would have it in my power to bestow on this
personification of fidelity and gentleness, I took my departure.</p>

<p>I felt myself placed in a very painful position for two or
three days after this interview, arising from a conviction
that I had not done enough for the salvation of this poor
victim, and yet without being able to fix upon any other
means of rendering her any assistance, unless I put into
execution a resolution that floated in my mind, to admonish
her husband, by an anonymous communication, and threaten
to divulge the secret of his guilt, unless he instantly desisted
from his nefarious purpose&mdash;a plan that did not receive
the entire sanction of my honour, however much it
enlisted the approbation of my feelings. Some further
time passed, and added, with its passing minutes, to my
mental disquietude. One evening, when I was sitting
meditating painfully on this sombre subject, a lackey,
superbly dressed, was introduced to me by my servant,
and stated that he had been commanded by his master
Colonel P&mdash;&mdash;, to request my attendance at his house
without delay. I started at the mention of the name, and
the nature of the message; and the man stared at me, as
I exhibited the irresolution of doubt and the perturbation
of surprise, in place of returning him a direct answer.
Recovering myself, I replied, that I would attend upon the
instant; and, indeed, I felt a greater anxiety to fly to that
house on which my thoughts were painfully fixed, than I
ever did to visit the most valued friend I ever attended in
distress. As I hurried along, I took little time to think of
the object of my call; but I suspected, either that Colonel
P&mdash;&mdash; had got some notice of my having secretly visited,
in my professional capacity, his wife, and being therefore
privy to his design&mdash;a state of opposing circumstances,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
which he was now to endeavour in some way to counteract&mdash;or
that, finding, from the extremity to which his
wife was reduced, that he was necessitated to call a doctor,
as a kind of cloak or cover to his cruel act, he had thus
made a virtue of necessity, when, alas! it would be too
late for my rendering the unfortunate creature any service.
&ldquo;He shall not, however, escape,&rdquo; muttered I, vehemently,
through my teeth, as I proceeded. &ldquo;He little knows that
he is now calling to his assistance the man that shall hang
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I soon arrived at the house, and rung the front door
bell. The same powdered lackey who had preceded me,
opened the door. I was led up two pair of stairs, and
found myself in the same lobby with which I had already
become somewhat familiar. I proceeded forward, thinking
I was destined for the sick chamber of the lady; but
the servant opened a door immediately next to that of her
room, and ushered me into an apartment furnished in an
elegant style, but much inferior to that occupied by his
wife. In a bed lay a man of a genteel, yet sinister cast of
countenance, with a large aquiline nose, and piercing
black eyes. He appeared very pale and feverish, and
threw upon me that anxious eye which we often find in
patients who are under the first access of a serious disease;
as if nature, while she kept her secret from the understanding,
communicated it to the feelings, whose eloquence,
expressed through the senses, we can often read with great
facility. I knew, in an instant, that he was committed,
by a relentless hand, to suffering, in all likelihood, in the
form of a fever. He told me he was Colonel P&mdash;&mdash;, and
that, having been very suddenly taken ill, he had become
alarmed for himself, and sent for me to administer to him
my professional services. I looked at him intently; but
he construed my stare into the eagerness of professional
investigation. At that instant, a piercing scream rang
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
through the house, and made my ears tingle. I asked
him who had uttered that scream, which must have come
from some creature in the very extremity of agony, and
made an indication as if I would hasten to administer relief
to the victim. In an instant, I was close and firm in
the trembling clutch of the sick man, who, with a wild and
confused look, begged me not to sacrifice him to any
attention to the cause of this disturbance, which was
produced by a servant in the house habitually given,
through fits of hysterics, to the utterance of these screams.
I put on an appearance of being satisfied with this statement;
but I fixed my eye relentlessly on him, as he still
shook, from the combined effects of his incipient disease,
and his fear of my investigating the cause of the scream.
I proceeded to examine into the nature of his complaint.
The symptoms described by him, and detected by my
observation, satisfied me that he had been seized with an
attack of virulent typhus; and from the intensity of some
of the indications&mdash;particularly his languor and small
pulse, his loss of muscular strength, violent pains in the
head, the inflammation of his eyes, the strong throbbing
of his temporal arteries, his laborious respiration, parched
tongue, and hot breath&mdash;I was convinced he had before
him the long sands of a rough and rapid race with death.
At the close of my investigation he looked anxiously and
wistfully in my face, and asked me what I conceived to be
the nature of his complaint. I told him at once, and with
greater openness and readiness than I usually practise,
that I was very much afraid he was committed for a severe
course of virulent typhus. He felt the full force of an
announcement which, to those who have had any experience
of this king of fevers, cannot fail to carry terror in
every syllable; and falling back on his pillow, turned up
his eye to heaven. At this moment, a succession of
screams, or rather yells, sounded through the house; but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
as I now saw that I had a chance of saving the innocent
sufferer, I pretended not to regard the dreadful sounds,
and purposely averted my eyes to escape the inquiring,
nervous look of the sick man. I gave him some directions,
promised to send some medicines, and took my leave.</p>

<p>As I shut the door, the waiting-maid, whom I had seen
before, was standing in the door of her mistress&#8217;s apartment,
and beckoned me in, with a look of terror and
secrecy. I was as anxious to visit her gentle mistress as
she was to call me. On entering, which I did slowly and
silently, to escape the ear of her husband, I found the
unfortunate creature in the most intense state of agony.
The ground glass she had swallowed, and a great part of
which, doubtless, adhered to the stomach, was too clearly
the cause of her screams; but, to my surprise, I discovered,
from her broken ejaculations, that the grief of her
husband&#8217;s illness had been able, in its strength, to fight its
way to her heart, through all her bodily agonies produced
by his poison. My questions regarding her own condition
were answered by hysterical sobs, mixed with ejaculations
of pity, and requests to know how he was, and what was
the nature of the complaint by which he had been attacked&mdash;hinting,
in dubious terms, that she had been the cause
of his illness, by entailing upon him the necessity of
attending her, and wounding his sensitive heart by her
distress. My former communications to her concerning
the poison, and my caution against her acceptance of it
from the hands of her intended murderer, had produced
no effect upon a mind predetermined to believe nothing
against the man she loved and trusted beyond all mortals.
She had received it again from him after my communication;
the effects of it were now exhibited in her tortured,
burning viscera; and yet, in the very midst of her agonies,
her faith, confidence, and love stood unshaken; a noble yet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
melancholy emblem of the most elevated, yet often least
valued and most abused virtues of her sex. I endeavoured
to answer her fevered inquiries about her husband,
by telling her that he stood in great <em>need of her attendance</em>;
and that, if she would agree to follow my precepts, and
put herself entirely under my advice and direction, she
might, in a very short time, be enabled to perform her
duty of a faithful wife and a kind nurse to her distressed
partner. The first perception she caught of the meaning
of my communication, lighted up her eye, even in the
midst of her wringing pains; and, starting up, she cried,
that she would be the most abject slave to my will, and
obey me in all things, if I could assure her of the blessing
of being able to act as nurse and comforter to her husband.
Now I saw my opportunity. On the instant I called up
and despatched the waiting-maid to my home, with directions
to my assistant, to send me instantly an oleaginous
mixture, and some powerful emetics, which I described in
a <em>recipe</em>. I waited the return of the messenger, administered
the medicines, and watched for a time their operation
and effects. Notwithstanding the continued attacks
that had been made on her system by the doses of an active
poison, I was satisfied that, if my energies were not, in
some unforeseen way, thwarted and opposed, I would be
able to bring this deserving wife and pattern of her sex
from the brink of the grave that had been dug for
her by the hand of her husband. After leaving with the
waiting-maid some directions, I proceeded home, for the
purpose of preparing the necessary medicines for my other
patient.</p>

<p>I now commenced a series of regular visits to my two
patients&mdash;the illness of the husband affording me the most
ample scope for saving his wife. As he gradually descended
into the unavoidable depths of his inexorable
disease, she, by the elastic force of youth and a good constitution,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
operating in unison with my medicines, which
were administered with the greatest regularity, gradually
threw off the lurking poison, and advanced to a state of
comparative safety and strength. I was much pleased to
observe the salutary effects of my professional interference
in behalf of my interesting patient; but could scarcely
credit my own perceptions, as I had exhibited to me the most
undoubted proofs, that the desire to minister to the wants
and comforts of her sick husband, engrossed so completely
every other feeling that might have been supposed consequent
upon a restoration to health, that she seemed to
disregard all other considerations. Her questions about
the period when she might be able to attend him were
unremitting; and every hour she was essaying to walk,
though her efforts often ended in weak falls, or sinkings
on the ground, when some one was required to assist her
in getting up and returning to bed. She entreated me to
allow her to be <em>carried</em> to his bedside; where, she said,
they might mix their tears and console each other; and
all my arguments against the impropriety of such an
obvious mode of increasing her husband&#8217;s illness, and
augmenting those sufferings she was so solicitous to
ameliorate, were scarcely sufficient to prevent her from
putting her design into execution.</p>

<p>The husband&#8217;s disease, which often runs a course of two
months, though the crisis occurs generally between the
third and fourth week, progressed steadily and relentlessly,
mocking, as the fevers of that type generally do, all the
boasted art of our profession. His pulse rose to the
alarming height of 120; he exhibited the oppression at
the chest, increased thirst, blackfurred tongue, and inarticulate,
muttering speech, which are considered to be
unfavourable indications; and there was, besides, a clear
tendency to delirium&mdash;a common, yet critical symptom&mdash;leaving,
even after the patient has recovered, and often for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
years, its marks in the weakened intellect. One evening
I was standing by his bedside, studying his symptoms;
witnessing the excess of his sufferings, and listening to the
bursts of incoherent speech which, from time to time, came
from him, as if expelled from his sick spirit by some internal
power. He spoke often of his wife, whom he called
by the name of Espras; and, in the midst of his broken
ejaculations, gushes of intense feeling came on him, filling
his yellow sunken eyes with rheumy tears, and producing
heavy sobs, which, repressed by his loaded chest, assumed
sounds unlike anything I ever heard, and beyond my
power of description. I could not well understand these
indications of the working of his spirit; but I fancied
that, when he felt his own agonies, became conscious of
what it is to suffer a certain extremity of pain, and learned,
for the first time in his life, the sad experience of an
inexorable disease, which presented to him the prospect of
a lingering death, his mind recurred to the situation of his
wife, who, as he thought, was, or might be, enduring
tortures produced by his hand, transcending even his
sufferings. There seemed to be less of conscience in his
mental operations, than a new-born sorrow or sympathy,
wrung out of a heart naturally obdurate, by the anguish
of a personal experience of the pain he himself had produced
in another, who had the strongest claims on his
protection and love. His mind, though volatile and
wandering, and not far from verging on delirium, was not
yet deranged; and I was about to put a question to him
concerning his wife, whom he had not directly mentioned
to me, when the door opened, and the still pale and
emaciated figure of Mrs. P&mdash;&mdash;, dressed in a white
morning gown, entered the apartment, struggling with
her weakness to get forward, and clutching, in her breathless
efforts, at whatever presented itself to her nerveless
arms, to support her, and aid her in her progress to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
sick-bed of her husband. The bed being in the middle of
a large room, she was necessitated to trust partly to the
weak powers of her limbs, which having failed her, she,
in an attempt to spring forward and reach it before
sinking, came short of her aim, and fell with a crash on
the floor, uttering, as she stumbled, a scream of sorrow,
wrung from her by the sight of her husband lying extended
on a bed of sickness. The noise started the
invalid, who turned his eyes wildly in the direction of the
disturbance; and I rushed forwards to raise in my arms
the exhausted victim. I had scarcely got her placed on
her feet, when she again struggled to reach the bed; and
having, by my assistance, got far enough forward, she
threw herself on the body of the fever-ridden patient,
ejaculating, as she seized him in her arms, and bedewed
his pale face with tears&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frederick! my honoured husband, whom I am bound
to cherish and nurse as becomes the fondest of wives, why
is it that I have been deprived of this luxury of the grief-stricken
heart&mdash;to watch your looks, and anticipate your
wants? Thanks to the blessed powers of your faith and
of mine, I have you now in my arms, and no mortal shall
come between me and my love! Night and day I will
watch and tend you, till the assiduities of my affection
weary out the effects of your cruel disease brought on you&mdash;O
God!&mdash;by your grief for me, your worthless Espras.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she buried her head in the bosom of the sick man,
and sobbed intensely. This scene, from the antithesis of
its circumstances, appeared to me the most striking I had
ever beheld; and, though it was my duty to prevent so
exciting a cause of disturbance to the patient, I felt I had
no power to stop this burst of true affection. I watched
narrowly the eye of the patient; but it was too much
clouded by the effects of the fever, and too nervous and
fugacious, to enable me to distinguish between the effects
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
of disease and the working of the natural affections. But
that his mind and feelings were working, and were
responding to this powerful moral impulse, was proved
fearfully by his rapid indistinct muttering and jabbering,
mixed with deep sighs, and the peculiar sound of the
repressed sobs which I have already mentioned, but cannot
assimilate to any sound I ever heard. All my efforts to
remove the devoted wife by entreaty were vain; she still
clung to him, as if he had been on the eve of being taken
from her by death. Her sobbing continued unabated, and
her tears fell on his cheek. These intense expressions of
love and sorrow awoke the sympathy which I thought had
previously been partially excited, for I now observed that
he turned away his head, while a stream of tears flowed
down his face. It was now, I found, necessary, for the sake
of the patient, to remove the excited lady; and I was
obliged to apply a gentle force before I could accomplish
my purpose. She insisted, however, upon remaining in
the room, and beseeched me so piteously for this privilege,
that I consented to a couch being made up for her at a
little distance from the bed of her husband, whom it was
her determination to tend and nurse, to the exclusion of
all others. I was not, indeed, ill pleased at this resolution,
for I anticipated, from her unexampled love and devotedness,
an effect on the heart of her husband which might
cure its vices and regenerate its affections.</p>

<p>On the next occasion of my stated visit, I found my
patient had at last fallen into a state of absolute delirium.
On a soft arm-chair, situated by his bedside, sat his wife,
the picture of despair, wringing her hands, and indulging
in the most extravagant demonstrations of grief and affection.
The wretched man exhibited the ordinary symptoms
of that unnatural excitement of the brain under which he
laboured&mdash;relapsing at times into silence, then uttering a
multiplicity of confused words&mdash;jabbering wildly&mdash;looking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
about him with that extraordinary expression of the eye,
as if every individual present was viewed as a murderer&mdash;then
starting up, and, with an overstrained and choking
voice, vociferating his frenzied thoughts, and then again
relapsing into silence. It is but little we can do for
patients in this extreme condition; but the faith his wife
reposed in professional powers that had already saved her,
suggested supplications and entreaties which I told her she
had better direct to a higher Dispensator of hope and
relief. The tumultuous thoughts of the raving victim
were still at intervals rolling forth; and, all of a sudden, I
was startled by a great increase of the intensity and connectedness
of his speech. He had struck the chord that
sounded most fearfully in his own ears. His attempt to
murder the creature who now sat and heard his wild confession,
was described by himself in intelligible, though
broken sentences:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fortune brought me by Espras,&rdquo; he vociferated,
&ldquo;is loaded by the burden of herself&mdash;that glass is not well
ground&mdash;you are not so ill, my dear Espras, as to require
a doctor&mdash;I cannot bear the thought of you labouring
under that necessity&mdash;who can cure you so well as your
devoted husband? Take this&mdash;fear not&mdash;why should love
have suspicions? When she is gone, I shall have a wife
of whom I may not be ashamed&mdash;yet, is she not a stranger
in a foreign land? Has she not left her country, her relations,
her friends, her gods, for me, whom she has raised
to opulence? Cease, cease&mdash;I cannot stand these thoughts&mdash;there
is a strife in this heart between the powers of hell
and heaven&mdash;when will it terminate, and who shall rule
my destiny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>These words, which he accompanied with wild gestures,
were followed by his usual indistinct muttering and jabbering.
I directed my gaze upon his wife. She sat in the
chair, motionless, with her eyes fixed on the ground as if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
she had been struck with death in that position, and been
stiffened into a rigidity which retained her in her place.
The issues of her tenderness and affection seemed to have
been sent back upon the heart, whose pulses they stopped.
The killing pain of an ingratitude, ingeniously heightened
to the highest grade of that hell-king of all human crimes,
operating upon a mind rendered so sensitively susceptible
of its influences, paralyzed the whole moral constitution of
the devoted creature, and realized the poetical creation of
despair. I felt inclined to soften the sternness of her grief,
by quickening her disbelief of the raving thoughts of a
fever-maniac; but I paused as I thought of the probable
necessity of her suspicion for her future safety from the
schemes of a murderer, whose evil desires might be resuscitated
by the return of health. I could do nothing more
at that time for the dreadful condition of the wretched
husband, and less for the more dreadful state of the miserable
wife; and the personal pain I experienced in witnessing
this high-wrought scene of terror, forced me to depart,
leaving the one still raving in his madness, and the other
bound in the stern grasp of the most awful of all moral
visitations.</p>

<p>I expected that on my next visit I would find such a
change on my patient as would enable me to decide
whether he would live or die; but he was still delirious,
with the crowded thoughts of the events of his past life
careering through his fevered brain, as if their restlessness
and agitation were produced by the burning fires that
chased them from their legitimate territory of the mind.
There was, however, a change in one quarter. His wife&#8217;s
confidence and affection had withstood and triumphed
over the attack of the previous day, and she was again
occupied in hanging over her raving husband, shedding
on his unconscious face the tear of pity, and supplying, by
anticipation, every want that could be supposed incident
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
to his miserable condition. This new and additional proof
of the strength of this woman&#8217;s steadfastness, in her unparalleled
fidelity and love, struck me even more forcibly
than the previous indications she had given of this extraordinary
feature in her character. But I was uncertain
yet whether to construe her conduct as salutary or dangerous
to her own personal interests&mdash;a circumstance depending
on the further development of the sentiments of
her husband. On that same evening the change suspected
took place: the delirium abated, and consciousness, that
had been driven forcibly from her throne, hastened to
assume the sceptre of her authority. The crisis was past,
and the patient began to be sensible of those attentions on
the part of his devoted wife, which had not only the merit
of being unremitting, but that of being sweetened by the
tears of solicitude and the blandness of love. I marked
attentively the first impressions made by her devotedness
on the returning sense. I saw his look following her eye,
which was continually inflamed and bedewed by the effects
of her grief; and, after he had for a period of time fixed
his half-conscious, half-wondering gaze on her, he turned
it suddenly away, but not before he gave sufficient indications
of sympathy and sorrow in a gush of tears. These
manifestations were afterwards often repeated; but I
thought I sometimes could perceive an abruptness in his
manner, and a painful impatience of the minute, refined,
and ingenious attentions of a highly-impassioned affection,
which left me in doubt whether, after his disease was removed,
sufficient reliance could be placed on the stability
of his regeneration.</p>

<p>In my subsequent visits I kept up my study of the
operations of his mind as well as the changes of his disease.
His wife&#8217;s attentions seemed rather to increase with the
improvement of his health and her increased ability to
discharge the duties of affection. He had improved so far
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
as to be in a condition to receive medicines for the recovery
of the tone of his stomach. I seized the opportunity of his
wife leaving for a short time his sick room, and, as I seated
myself on her chair by the bedside, I took from my pocket
the powder of iron-filings and triturated glass he had prepared
for the poisoning of her who had latterly been contributing
all the energies of love to the saving of his life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A chalybeate mixture,&rdquo; said I, while I fixed my eyes
on his countenance, &ldquo;has been recommended for patients
in your condition, for improving the power of the stomach
weakened by the continued nausea of a protracted fever.
Here is a powder composed of iron-filings, a good chalybeate,
which I found lying in your wife&#8217;s apartment. I
have none better in my laboratory, and would recommend
to you a full dose of it before I depart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The electric effect of this statement was instantaneous
and remarkable. He seemed like one who had felt the
sharp sting of a musket bullet sent into his body by a
hand unseen&mdash;uncertain of the nature of the wound, or of
the aim by which it is produced. A sudden suspicion
relieved his still fevered eye, which threw upon me the
full blaze of staring wonder and terror, while an accompanying
uncertainty of my intention sealed his mouth and
added curiosity to his look. But I followed up my intention
resolutely and determinedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is on the table,&rdquo; continued I, &ldquo;a mucilaginous
vehicle for its conveyance into the stomach. I shall prepare
it instantly. To seize quickly the handle of an auspicious
occasion is the soul of our art.&rdquo;&mdash;(Approaching the
bed with the medicine in my hand.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot, I cannot take that medicine,&rdquo; he cried, wildly.
&ldquo;What means this? Help me, Heaven, in this emergency!
I cannot, I dare not take that medicine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said I, still eyeing him intently. &ldquo;Is it because
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
there is ground glass in it? That cannot be;
because I understand it was intended for Espras, your
loving, faithful wife; and who would administer so dreadful
a poison to a creature so gentle and interesting? She
is, besides, a foreigner in our land; and who would treat
the poor unprotected stranger with the dainty that has
concealed in it a lurking death? Is this the hospitality of
Britain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every word was a thunderstroke to his heart. All
uncertainty fled before these flaming sarcasms, which carried,
on the bolt of truth, the keenness of his own poison.
His pain became intense, and exhibited the peculiarity of
a mixture of extreme terror, directed towards me as one
that had the power of hanging him, and of intense sorrow
for the injury he had produced to the wife of his bosom,
whose emaciated figure, hanging over him in his distress,
must have been deeply imprinted on his soul. Yet it was
plain that his sorrow overcame his fear; for I saw his
bosom heaving with an accumulation of hysterical emotions,
which convulsed his frame in the intense manner of
the aerial ball that chokes the female victim of excited
nerves. The struggle lasted for several minutes, and at
last a burst of dissolving tenderness, removing all the obstructions
of prudence or terror, and stunning my ear with
its loud sound, afforded him a temporary relief. Tears
gushed down his cheeks, and groans of sorrow filled the
room, and might have been heard in the apartment of his
wife, whose entry, I feared, might have interrupted the
extraordinary scene. Looking at me wistfully, he held
out his hands, and sobbed out, in a tone of despair&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you my friend, or are you my enemy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I answered him that I was the friend of his wife&mdash;one of
the brightest patterns of female fidelity I had ever seen;
and if by declaring myself his friend I would save her from
the designs of the poisoner, and him from the pains of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
law and the fire of hell, I would instantly sign the bond of
amity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have knocked from my soul the bonds of terror,&rdquo;
he cried out, still sobbing; &ldquo;and if I knew and were satisfied
of one thing more, I would resign myself to God and
my own breaking heart. Did Espras&mdash;yet why should I
suspect one who rejects suspicion as others do the poison
she would swallow from my hand, though labelled by the
apothecary?&mdash;did Espras tell you what you have so darkly
and fearfully hinted to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I replied to him that, in place of telling me, the faithful
unsuspecting creature had to that hour rejected and
spurned the suspicion, as unworthy of her pure, confiding
spirit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is over!&mdash;it is over!&rdquo; cried the changed man. &ldquo;O
God! How powerful is virtue! How strong is the force
of those qualities of the heart which we men often treat as
weak baubles to toy with, and throw away in our fits of
proud spleen&mdash;the softness, the gentleness, the fidelity and
devotedness of woman! How strangely, how wonderfully
formed is the heart of man, which, disdaining the terrors
of the rope of the executioner, breaks and succumbs at
the touch of the thistle-down of a woman&#8217;s love! This
creature, sir, gave me my fortune, made me what I am,
left for me her country and her friends, adhered to me
through good and evil report&mdash;and I prepared for her a
cruel death! Dreadful contrast! Who shall describe the
shame, the sorrow, the humiliation, of the ingrate whose
crime has risen to the fearful altitude of this enormity;
and who, by the tenderness and love of his devoted victim,
is forced to turn his eye on the grim reward of death for
love, riches, and life? Gentle, beloved, injured Espras!
that emaciated form, these trembling limbs, these sunken
eyes, and these weak and whispering sounds of pity and
affection have touched my heart with a power that never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
was vouchsafed to the tongue of eloquence. Transcending
the rod of Moses, they have brought from the rock streams
of blood; and every pulse is filled with tenderness and
pity. Wretched fool! I was ashamed of your nativity,
and of the colour you inherited from nature, and never
estimated the qualities of your heart; but when shall the
red-and-white beauty of England transcend my Espras in
her fidelity and love, as she does in the skin-deep tints of
a beguiling, treacherous face? God! what a change has
come over this heart! Thanks, and prayers, and tears of
blood, never can express the gratitude it owes to the
great Author of our being for this miraculous return to
virtue, effected by the simple means of a woman&#8217;s confidence
and love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he finished this impassioned speech, which I have
repeated as correctly as my memory enabled me to commit
to my note-book, he turned his eyes upwards, and
remained for at least five minutes in silent prayer. As he
was about finishing his wife entered. Her appearance
called forth from his excited mind a burst of affection, and
seizing her in his arms, he wept over her like a child.
He was met as fervently by the gentle and affectionate
creature, who, grateful to God for this renewed expression
of her husband&#8217;s love, turned up her eyes to heaven,
and wept aloud. I never witnessed a scene like this. I
left them to their enjoyment, and returned home.</p>

<p>I was subsequently a constant visitor at the house of
Colonel P&mdash;&mdash;; and, about eighteen months after his recovery,
I officiated as accoucheur to his wife on the occasion
of the birth of a son. Other children followed afterwards,
and bound closer the bonds of that conjugal love
which I had some hand in producing, and which I saw
increase daily through a long course of years.</p>

<h2>THE ADOPTED SON.</h2>

<h3>A TALE OF THE TIMES OF THE COVENANTERS.</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Oh, for the sword of Gideon, to rid the land of tyrants,
to bring down the pride of apostates, and to smite the ungodly
with confusion!&rdquo; muttered John Brydone to himself,
as he went into the fields in the September of 1645, and
beheld that the greater part of a crop of oats, which had
been cut down a few days before, was carried off. John
was the proprietor of about sixty acres on the south bank of
the Ettrick, a little above its junction with the Tweed. At
the period we speak of, the talented and ambitious Marquis
of Montrose, who had long been an apostate to the cause of
the Covenant&mdash;and not only an apostate, but its most powerful
enemy&mdash;having, as he thought, completely crushed its
adherents in Scotland, in the pride of his heart led his
followers towards England, to support the tottering cause of
Charles in the south, and was now with his cavalry quartered
at Selkirk, while his infantry were encamped at Philiphaugh,
on the opposite side of the river.</p>

<p>Every reader has heard of Melrose Abbey&mdash;which is still
venerated in its decay, majestic in its ruins&mdash;and they have
read, too, of the abode of the northern wizard, who shed
the halo of his genius over the surrounding scenery. But
many have heard of Melrose, of Scott, and of Abbotsford,
to whom the existence of Philiphaugh is unknown. It,
however, is one of those places where our forefathers laid
the foundation of our freedom with the bones of its enemies,
and cemented it with their own blood. If the stranger
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
who visits Melrose and Abbotsford pursue his journey a few
miles farther, he may imagine that he is still following the
source of the Tweed, until he arrive at Selkirk, when he
finds that for some miles he has been upon the banks of the
Ettrick, and that the Tweed is lost among the wooded hills
to the north. Immediately below Selkirk, and where the
forked river forms a sort of island, on the opposite side of
the stream, he will see a spacious haugh, surrounded by
wooded hills, and forming, if we may so speak, an amphitheatre
bounded by the Ettrick, between the Yarrow and
the Tweed. Such is Philiphaugh; where the arms of the
Covenant triumphed, and where the sword of Montrose was
blunted for ever.</p>

<p>Now, the sun had not yet risen, and a thick, dark mist
covered the face of the earth, when, as we have said, John
Brydone went out into his fields, and found that a quantity
of his oats had been carried away. He doubted not but
they had been taken for the use of Montrose&#8217;s cavalry; and
it was not for the loss of his substance that he grieved,
and that his spirit was wroth, but because it was taken to
assist the enemies of his country, and the persecutors of the
truth; for than John Brydone, humble as he was, there was
not a more dauntless or a more determined supporter of the
Covenant in all Scotland. While he yet stood by the side
of his field, and, from the thickness of the morning, was
unable to discern objects at a few yards&#8217; distance, a party of
horsemen rode up to where he stood. &ldquo;Countryman,&rdquo; said
one who appeared to be their leader, &ldquo;can you inform us
where the army of Montrose is encamped?&rdquo;</p>

<p>John, taking them to be a party of the Royalists, sullenly
replied&mdash;&ldquo;There&#8217;s mony ane asks the road they ken,&rdquo; and
was proceeding into the field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer me!&rdquo; demanded the horseman angrily, and
raising a pistol in his hand&mdash;&ldquo;Sir David Lesly commands
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
&ldquo;Sir David Lesly!&rdquo; cried John&mdash;&ldquo;the champion of the
truth!&mdash;the defender of the good cause! If ye be Sir
David Lesly, as I trow ye be, get yer troops in readiness,
and, before the mist vanish on the river, I will deliver the
host o&#8217; the Philistines into your hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See that ye play not the traitor,&rdquo; said Lesly, &ldquo;or the
nearest tree shall be unto thee as the gallows was to Haman
which he prepared for Mordecai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do even so to me, and more also,&rdquo; replied John, &ldquo;if ye
find me false. But think ye that I look as though I bore
the mark of the beast upon my forehead?&rdquo; he continued,
taking off his Lowland bonnet, and gazing General Lesly
full in the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will trust you,&rdquo; said the General; and, as he spoke,
the van of his army appeared in sight.</p>

<p>John having described the situation of the enemy to Sir
David, acted as their guide until they came to the Shaw
Burn, when the General called a halt. Each man having
partaken of a hurried repast, by order of Sir David, the word
was given along the line that they should return thanks for
being conducted to the place where the enemy of the Kirk
and his army slept in imaginary security. The preachers at
the head of the different divisions of the army gave out a
psalm, and the entire host of the Covenanters, uncovering
their heads, joined at the same moment in thanksgiving and
praise. John Brydone was not a man of tears, but, as he
joined in the psalm, they rolled down his cheeks, for his
heart felt, while his tongue uttered praise, that a day of
deliverance for the people of Scotland was at hand. The
psalm being concluded, each preacher offered up a short but
earnest prayer; and each man, grasping his weapon, was
ready to lay down his life for his religion and his liberty.</p>

<p>John Brydone, with his bonnet in hand, approaching Sir
David, said&mdash;&ldquo;Now, sir, I that ken the ground, and the
situation o&#8217; the enemy, would advise ye, as a man who has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
seen some service mysel&#8217;, to halve your men; let the one
party proceed by the river to attack them on the one
side, and the other go round the hills to cut off their
retreat.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye speak skilfully,&rdquo; said Sir David, and he gave orders
as John Brydone had advised.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Montrose had been disappointed in reinforcements
from his sovereign. Of two parties which had
been sent to assist him in his raid into England, one had
been routed in Yorkshire, and the other defeated on Carlisle
sands, and only a few individuals from both parties joined
him at Selkirk. A great part of his Highlanders had returned
home to enjoy their plunder; but his army was still
formidable, and he imagined that he had Scotland at his
feet, and that he had nothing to fear from anything the
Covenanters could bring against him. He had been writing
despatches throughout the night; and he was sitting in
the best house in Selkirk, penning a letter to his sovereign,
when he was startled by the sounds of cannon and of musketry.
He rushed to the street. The inhabitants were
hurrying from their houses&mdash;many of his cavalry were
mingling, half-dressed, with the crowd. &ldquo;To horse!&mdash;to
horse!&rdquo; shouted Montrose. His command was promptly
obeyed; and, in a few minutes, at the head of his cavalry,
he rushed down the street leading to the river towards
Philiphaugh. The mist was breaking away, and he beheld
his army fleeing in every direction. The Covenanters had
burst upon them as a thunderbolt. A thousand of his best
troops lay dead upon the field.<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a>
He endeavoured to rally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
them, but in vain; and, cutting his way through the Covenanters,
he fled at his utmost speed, and halted not until
he had arrived within a short distance of where the delightful
watering town of Innerleithen now stands, when he sought
a temporary resting-place in the house of Lord Traquair.</p>

<p>John Brydone, having been furnished with a sword, had
not been idle during the engagement; but, as he had fought
upon foot, and the greater part of Lesly&#8217;s army were cavalry,
he had not joined in the pursuit; and, when the battle was
over, he conceived it to be as much his duty to act the part
of the Samaritan, as it had been to perform that of a soldier.
He was busied, therefore, on the field in administering, as
he could, to the wounded; and whether they were Cavalier
or Covenanter, it was all one to John; for he was not one
who could trample on a fallen foe, and in their hour of need
he considered all men as brothers. He was passing within
about twenty yards of a tent upon the Haugh, which had
a superior appearance to the others&mdash;it was larger, and the
cloth which covered it was of a finer quality; when his attention
was arrested by a sound unlike all that belonged to
a battle-field&mdash;the wailing and the cries of an infant! He
looked around, and near him lay the dead body of a lady,
and on her breast, locked in her cold arms, a child of a few
months old was struggling. He ran towards them&mdash;he
perceived that the lady was dead&mdash;he took the child in his
arms&mdash;he held it to his bosom&mdash;he kissed its cheek&mdash;&ldquo;Puir
thing!&mdash;puir thing!&rdquo; said John; &ldquo;the innocent hae been
left to perish amang the unrighteous.&rdquo; He was bearing
away the child, patting its cheek, and caressing it as he
went, and forgetting the soldier in the nurse, when he said
unto himself&mdash;&ldquo;Puir innocent!&mdash;an&#8217; belike yer wrang-headed
faither is fleeing for his life, an&#8217; thinking aboot ye
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
an&#8217; yer mother as he flees! Weel, ye may be claimed some
day, an&#8217; I maun do a&#8217; in my power to gie an account o&#8217; ye.&rdquo;
So John turned back towards the lifeless body of the child&#8217;s
mother; and he perceived that she wore a costly ring upon
her finger, and bracelets on her arms; she also held a small
parcel, resembling a book, in her hands, as though she had
fled with it, without being able to conceal it, and almost at
the door of her tent she had fallen with her child in her
arms, and her treasure in her hand. John stooped upon the
ground, and took the ring from her finger, and the bracelets
from her arms; he took also the packet from her hands,
and in it he found other jewels, and a purse of gold pieces.
&ldquo;These may find thee a faither, puir thing,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;or
if they do not, they may befriend thee when John Brydone
cannot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He carried home the child to his own house, and his wife
having at that time an infant daughter at her breast, she
took the foundling from her husband&#8217;s arms, and became
unto it as a mother, nursing it with her own child. But
John told not his wife of the purse, nor the ring, nor the
rich jewels.</p>

<p>The child had been in their keeping for several weeks,
but no one appeared to claim him. &ldquo;The bairn may hae
been baptized,&rdquo; said John; &ldquo;but it wud be after the
fashion o&#8217; the sons o&#8217; Belial; but he is a brand plucked from
the burning&mdash;he is my bairn noo, and I shall be unto him
as a faither&mdash;I&#8217;ll tak upon me the vows&mdash;and, as though
he were flesh o&#8217; my ain flesh, I will fulfil them.&rdquo; So the
child was baptized. In consequence of his having been
found on Philiphaugh, and of the victory there gained, he
was called Philip; and as John had adopted him as his
son, he bore also the name of Brydone. It is unnecessary
for us to follow the foundling through his years of boyhood.
John had two children&mdash;a son named Daniel, and Mary,
who was nursed at his mother&#8217;s breast with the orphan
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
Philip. As the boy grew up, he called his protectors by
the name of father and mother; but he knew they were not
such, for John had shown him the spot upon the Haugh
where he had found him wailing on the bosom of his dead
mother. Frequently, too, when he quarrelled with his playfellows,
they would call him the &ldquo;Philiphaugh foundling,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;the Cavalier&#8217;s brat;&rdquo; and on such occasions Mary was
wont to take his part, and, weeping, say &ldquo;he was her brother.&rdquo;
As he grew up, however, it grieved his protector
to observe that he manifested but little of the piety, and
less of the sedateness of his own children. &ldquo;What is born
i&#8217; the bane, isna easily rooted oot o&#8217; the flesh,&rdquo; said John;
and in secret he prayed and wept that his adopted son
might be brought to a knowledge of the truth. The days of
the Commonwealth had come, and John and his son Daniel
rejoiced in the triumphs of the Parliamentary armies, and
the success of its fleets; but, while they spoke, Philip would
mutter between his teeth&mdash;&ldquo;It is the triumph of murderers!&rdquo;
He believed that but for the ascendancy of the Commonwealth,
he might have obtained some tidings of his family;
and this led him to hate a cause which the activity of his
spirit might have tempted him to embrace.</p>

<p>Mary Brydone had always been dear to him; and, as he
grew towards manhood, he gazed on her beautiful features
with delight; but it was not the calm delight of a brother
contemplating the fair face of a sister; for Philip&#8217;s heart
glowed as he gazed, and the blush gathered on his cheek.
One summer evening they were returning from the fields
together, the sun was sinking in the west, the Ettrick murmured
along by their side, and the voice of the wood-dove
was heard from the copse-wood which covered the hills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you so sad, brother Philip?&rdquo; said Mary;
&ldquo;would you hide anything from your own sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not call me <em>brother</em>, Mary,&rdquo; said he
earnestly&mdash;&ldquo;do not call me <em>brother</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
&ldquo;Who would call you brother, Philip, if I did not?&rdquo; returned
she affectionately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let Daniel call me brother,&rdquo; said he, eagerly; &ldquo;but not
you&mdash;not you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She burst into tears. &ldquo;When did I offend you, Philip,&rdquo;
she added, &ldquo;that I may not call you brother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never, Mary!&mdash;never!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;call me Philip&mdash;<em>your</em>
Philip!&mdash;anything but brother!&rdquo; He took her hand
within his&mdash;he pressed it to his bosom. &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;I have neither father, mother, brother, nor kindred&mdash;I am
alone in the world&mdash;let there be something that I can call
<em>mine</em>&mdash;something that will love me in return! Do you
understand me, Mary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are cruel, Philip,&rdquo; said she, sobbing as she spoke;
&ldquo;you know I love you&mdash;I have always loved you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! as you love Daniel&mdash;as you love your father; but
not as&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You love Mr. Duncan,&rdquo; he would have said; but his
heart upbraided him for the suspicion, and he was silent. It
is here necessary to inform the reader that Mr. Duncan was
a preacher of the Covenant, and John Brydone revered him
much. He was much older than Mary, but his heart cleaved
to her, and he had asked her father&#8217;s consent to become his
son-in-law. John, though a stern man, was not one who
would force the inclination of his daughter; but Mr. Duncan
was, as he expressed it, &ldquo;one of the faithful in Israel,&rdquo; and
his proposal was pleasing to him. Mary, however, regarded
the preacher with awe, but not with affection.</p>

<p>Mary felt that she understood Philip&mdash;that she loved
him, and not as a brother. She hid her face upon his
shoulder, and her hand returned the pressure of his. They
entered the house together, and her father perceived that
his daughter&#8217;s face was troubled. The manner of both was
changed. He was a shrewd man as well as a stern man,
and he also suspected the cause.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
&ldquo;Philip,&rdquo; said he calmly, &ldquo;for twenty years hae I protected
ye, an&#8217; watched ower ye wi&#8217; a faither&#8217;s care, an&#8217; I
fear that, in return for my care, ye hae brought sorrow into
the bosom o&#8217; my family, an&#8217; instilled disobedience into the
flesh o&#8217; my ain flesh. But though ye hae cleaved&mdash;as it
maun hae been inherent in your bluid&mdash;into the principles
o&#8217; the sons o&#8217; this warld, yet, as I ne&#8217;er found ye guilty o&#8217; a
falsehood, an&#8217; as I believe ye incapable o&#8217; are, tell me truly,
why is your countenance an&#8217; that o&#8217; Mary changed&mdash;and
why are ye baith troubled to look me straight in the face?
Answer me&mdash;hae ye taught her to forget that she is your
sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; answered Philip; &ldquo;and can it offend the man
who saved me, who has watched over me, and sheltered me
from infancy till now, that I should wish to be his son in
more than in name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does offend me, Philip,&rdquo; said the Covenanter; &ldquo;even
unto death it offends me! I hae consented that my dochter
shall gie her hand to a guid an&#8217; a godly man, who will look
after her weelfare baith here and hereafter. And ye kenned
this&mdash;she kenned it, and she didna refuse; but ye hae come
like the son o&#8217; darkness, an&#8217; sawn tares amang the wheat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;if you will still allow me to call
you by that name&mdash;foundling though I am&mdash;unknown as I
am&mdash;in what am I worse than him to whom you would
sacrifice your daughter&#8217;s happiness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sacrifice her happiness!&rdquo; interrupted the old man;
&ldquo;hoo daur ye speak o&#8217; happiness, wha kens nae meanin&#8217; for
the word but the vain pleasures o&#8217; this sinfu&#8217; warld! Think
ye that, as a faither, an&#8217; as ane that has my offspring to
answer for, that I daur sacrifice the eternal happiness o&#8217; my
bairn, for the gratification o&#8217; a temporary feelin&#8217; which ye
encourage the day and may extinguish the morn? Na,
sir; they wha wad ken what true happiness is, maun first
learn to crucify human passions. Mary,&rdquo; added he,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
sternly, turning to his daughter, &ldquo;repeat the fifth commandment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had been weeping before, and she now wept aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Repeat it!&rdquo; replied her father yet more sternly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honour thy father and thy mother,&rdquo; added she, sobbing
as she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, then, bairn,&rdquo; replied her father, &ldquo;that ye remember
that commandment in yer heart, as weel as on yer
tongue. Remember, too, that o&#8217; a&#8217; the commands, it&#8217;s the
only ane to which a promise is attached; and, noo, mark
what I say, an&#8217;, as ye wadna disobey me, see, at yer peril,
that ye ne&#8217;er permit this young man to speak to ye again,
save only as a brither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;we have grown up together like
twin tendrils on the same vine, and can ye wonder that our
hearts have become entwined round each other, or that they
can tear asunder because ye command it! Or, could I look
on the face of an angel&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out on ye, blasphemer!&rdquo; interrupted the Covenanter&mdash;&ldquo;wad
ye apply siccan epithets to a bairn o&#8217; mine? Once
for all, hear me, Philip; there are but twa ways o&#8217;t, and ye
can tak yer choice. It&#8217;s the first time I hae spoken to ye
roughly, but it isna the first time my spirit has mourned
ower ye. I hae tried to lead ye in the right path; ye hae
had baith precept and example afore ye; but the leaven o&#8217;
this warld&mdash;the leaven o&#8217; the persecutors o&#8217; the Kirk and
the Covenant&mdash;was in yer very bluid; an&#8217; I believe, if
opportunity had offered, ye wad hae drawn yer sword in the
unholy cause. A&#8217; that I could say, an&#8217; a&#8217; that I could do,
religion has ne&#8217;er had ony place in yer heart; but ye hae
yearned aboot yer faither, and ye hae mourned aboot yer
mother&mdash;an&#8217; that was natural aneugh&mdash;but oh! ye hae also
desired to cling to the cauld formality o&#8217; Episcopacy, as they
nae doot did: an&#8217; should ye e&#8217;er discover that yer parents
hae been Papists, I believe that ye wad become ane too!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
An&#8217; aften, when the conversation turned upon the apostate
Montrose, or the gallant Lesly, I hae seen ye manifest the
spirit an&#8217; the very look o&#8217; a persecutor. Were I to gie up
my dochter to such a man, I should be worse than the
heathen wha sacrifice their offspring to the abomination o&#8217;
idols. Noo, Philip, as I hae tauld ye, there are but twa ways
o&#8217;t. Either this very hour gie me your solemn promise that
ye will think o&#8217; Mary as to be yer wife nae mair, or, wi&#8217; the
risin&#8217; o&#8217; to-morrow&#8217;s sun, leave this house for ever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Philip bitterly, &ldquo;your last command I can
obey, though it would be with a sad heart&mdash;though it
would be in despair&mdash;your first I cannot&mdash;I will not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must&mdash;you <em>shall</em>!&rdquo; replied the Covenanter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; answered Philip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; replied the old man, &ldquo;leave the roof that has
sheltered ye frae yer cradle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo; said Philip, and the tears ran down his cheeks.
He walked towards Mary, and, with a faltering voice,
said&mdash;&ldquo;Farewell, Mary!&mdash;Farewell! I did not expect this;
but do not forget me&mdash;do not give your hand to another&mdash;and
we shall meet again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall not!&rdquo; interrupted the inexorable old man.</p>

<p>Mary implored her father, for her sake, and for the sake
of her departed mother, who had loved Philip as her own
son, that he would not drive him from the house, and
Daniel, too, entreated; but their supplications were vain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farewell, then!&rdquo; said Philip; &ldquo;and, though I depart
in misery, let it not be with thy curse, but let the blessing
of him who has been to me a father until now, go with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The blessin&#8217; o&#8217; Heaven be wi&#8217; ye and around ye, Philip!&rdquo;
groaned the Covenanter, struggling to conceal a
tear: &ldquo;but, if ye will follow the dictates o&#8217; yer rebellious
heart and leave us, tak wi&#8217; ye yer property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My property!&rdquo; replied Philip.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yer property,&rdquo; returned the old man. &ldquo;Twenty years
has it lain in that drawer, an&#8217; during that time eyes hae
not seen it, nor fingers touched it. It will assist ye noo;
an&#8217; when ye enter the warld, may throw some light upon
yer parentage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went to a small drawer, and, unlocking it, took out
the jewels, the bracelet, the ring, and the purse of gold,
and, placing them in Philip&#8217;s hands,
exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Fareweel!&mdash;fareweel!&mdash;but it maun be!&rdquo; and
he turned away his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Mary!&rdquo; cried Philip, &ldquo;keep&mdash;keep this in remembrance of me,&rdquo;
as he attempted to place the ring in her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Awa, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed the old man, vehemently, &ldquo;wad
ye bribe my bairn into disobedience, by the ornaments o&#8217;
folly an&#8217; iniquity! Awa, ye son o&#8217; Belial, an&#8217; provoke me
not to wrath!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Philip groaned, he dashed his hand upon his brow, and
rushed from the house. Mary wept long and bitterly, and
Daniel walked to and fro across the room, mourning for
one whom he loved as a brother. The old man went out
into the fields to conceal the agony of his spirit; and, when
he had wandered for a while, he communed with himself,
saying, &ldquo;I hae dune foolishly, an&#8217; an ungodly action hae I
performed this nicht; I hae driven oot a young man upon
a wicked warld, wi&#8217; a&#8217; his sins an&#8217; his follies on his head;
an&#8217;, if evil come upon him, or he plunge into the paths o&#8217;
wickedness, his bluid an&#8217; his guilt will be laid at my hands!
Puir Philip!&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;after a&#8217;, he had a kind heart!&rdquo;
And the stern old man drew the sleeve of his coat across his
eyes. In this frame of mind he returned to the house.
&ldquo;Has Philip not come back?&rdquo; said he, as he entered.
His son shook his head sorrowfully, and Mary sobbed more
bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rin ye awa doun to Melrose, Daniel,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;an&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
I&#8217;ll awa up to Selkirk, an&#8217; inquire for him, an&#8217; bring him
back. Yer faither has allowed passion to get the better o&#8217;
him, an&#8217; to owercome baith the man an&#8217; the Christian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run, Daniel, run!&rdquo; cried Mary eagerly. And the old
man and his son went out in search of him.</p>

<p>Their inquiries were fruitless. Days, weeks, and months
rolled on, but nothing more was heard of poor Philip.
Mary refused to be comforted; and the exhortations, the
kindness, and the tenderness shown towards her by the
Rev. Mr. Duncan, if not hateful, were disagreeable. Dark
thoughts, too, had taken possession of her father&#8217;s mind,
and he frequently sank into melancholy; for the thought
haunted him that his adopted son, on being driven from
his house, had laid violent hands upon his own life; and
this idea embittered every day of his existence.</p>

<p>More than ten years had passed since Philip had left the
house of John Brydone. The Commonwealth was at an
end, and the second Charles had been recalled; but exile
had not taught him wisdom, nor the fate of his father discretion.
He madly attempted to be the lord and ruler of
the people&#8217;s conscience, as well as King of Britain. He was
a libertine with some virtues&mdash;a bigot without religion. In
the pride, or rather folly of his heart, he attempted to force
Prelacy upon the people of Scotland; and he let his bloodhounds
loose, to hunt the followers of the Covenant from
hill to hill, to murder them on their own hearths, and, with
the blood of his victims, to blot out the word <em>conscience</em>
from the vocabulary of Scotchmen. The Covenanters
sought their God in the desert and on the mountains which
He had reared; they worshipped him in the temples which
His own hands had framed; and there the persecutor sought
them, the destroyer found them, and the sword of the tyrant
was bathed in the blood of the worshipper! Even the
family altar was profaned; and to raise the voice of prayer
and praise in the cottage to the King of kings, was held to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
be as treason against him who professed to represent Him
on earth. At this period, too, Graham of Claverhouse&mdash;whom
some have painted as an angel, but whose actions
were worthy of a fiend&mdash;at the head of his troopers, who
were called by the profane, <em>the ruling elders of the kirk</em>,
was carrying death and cold-blooded cruelty throughout the
land.</p>

<p>Now, it was on a winter night in the year 1677, a party
of troopers were passing near the house of old John Brydone,
and he was known to them not only as being one who was
a defender of the Covenant, but also as one who harboured
the preachers, and whose house was regarded as a
conventicle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us rouse the old psalm-singing heretic who lives
here from his knees,&rdquo; said one of the troopers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, let us stir him up,&rdquo; said the sergeant who had the
command of the party; &ldquo;he is an old offender, and I don&#8217;t
see we can make a better night&#8217;s work than drag him along,
bag and baggage, to the captain. I have heard as how it
was he that betrayed our commander&#8217;s kinsman, the gallant
Montrose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark! hark!&mdash;softly! softly!&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;let us
dismount&mdash;hear how the nasal drawl of the conventicle
moans through the air! My horse pricks his ears at the
sound already. We shall catch them in the act.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eight of the party dismounted, and, having given their
horses in charge to four of their comrades, who remained
behind, walked on tiptoe to the door of the cottage. They
heard the words given and sung&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;When cruel men against us rose</span><br />
 To make of us their prey!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, they are singing treason,&rdquo; said one of the troopers.
&ldquo;What more do we need?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sergeant placed his forefinger on his lips, and for
about ten minutes they continued to listen. The song
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
of praise ceased, and a person commenced to read a
chapter. They heard him also expound to his hearers as
he read.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is enough,&rdquo; said the sergeant; and, placing their
shoulders against the door, it was burst open. &ldquo;You are
our prisoners!&rdquo; exclaimed the troopers, each man grasping
a sword in his right hand, and a pistol in the left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the will of Heaven!&rdquo; said the Rev. Mr. Duncan;
for it was he who had been reading and expounding the
Scriptures; &ldquo;but, if ye stretch forth your hands against a
hair o&#8217; our heads, <span class="smcap">He</span>, without whom a sparrow cannot fall
to the ground, shall remember it against ye at the great
day o&#8217; reckoning, when the trooper will be stripped of
his armour, and his right hand shall be a witness against
him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The soldiers burst into a laugh of derision. &ldquo;No more
of your homily, reverend oracle,&rdquo; said the sergeant; &ldquo;I
have an excellent recipe for short sermons here; utter
another word and you shall have it!&rdquo; The troopers laughed
again, and the sergeant, as he spoke, held his pistol in the
face of the preacher.</p>

<p>Besides the clergyman, there were in the room old John
Brydone, his son Daniel, and Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, old greybeard,&rdquo; said the sergeant, addressing
John, &ldquo;you have been reported as a dangerous and disaffected
Presbyterian knave, as we find you to be; you
are also accused of being a harbourer and an accomplice of
the preachers of sedition; and, lo! we have found also that
your house is used as a conventicle. We have caught you
in the act, and we shall take every soul of you as evidence
against yourselves. So come along, old boy&mdash;I should only
be doing my duty by blowing your brains against the wall;
but that is a ceremony which our commander may wish to
see performed in his own presence!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;I neither fear ye nor your armed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
men. Tak me to the bloody Claverhouse, if you will, and
at the day o&#8217; judgment it shall be said&mdash;&lsquo;<em>Let the murderers
o&#8217; John Brydone stand forth!</em>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us despatch them at once,&rdquo; said one of the troopers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the sergeant; &ldquo;bind them together, and
drive them before us to the captain: I don&#8217;t know but he
may wish to <em>do justice</em> to them with his own hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel,&rdquo; groaned
Mr. Duncan.</p>

<p>Mary wrung her hands&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, spare my father!&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wheesht, Mary!&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;as soon wad a
camel pass through the eye o&#8217; a needle, as ye wad find compassion
in the hands o&#8217; these men!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bind the girl and the preacher together,&rdquo; said the
sergeant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, by your leave, sergeant,&rdquo; interrupted one of the
troopers, &ldquo;I wouldn&#8217;t be the man to lift a hand against
a pretty girl like that, if you would give me a regiment
for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, Macdonald,&rdquo; replied the sergeant&mdash;&ldquo;this comes
of your serving under that canting fellow, Lieutenant Mowbray&mdash;he
has no love for the service; and confound me if
I don&#8217;t believe he is half a Roundhead in his heart. Tie
the hands of the girl, I command you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not!&rdquo; returned Macdonald; &ldquo;and hang me if
any one else shall!&rdquo; And, with his sword in his hand, he
placed himself between Mary and his comrades.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you do not bind her hands, I shall cause others to
bind yours,&rdquo; said the sergeant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They may try that who dare!&rdquo; returned the soldier,
who was the most powerful man of the party; &ldquo;but what
I&#8217;ve said I&#8217;ll stand to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall answer for this to-morrow,&rdquo; said the sergeant,
sullenly, who feared to provoke a quarrel with the trooper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will answer it,&rdquo; replied the other.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
John Brydone, his son Daniel, and the Rev. Mr. Duncan,
were bound together with strong cords, and driven from
the house. They were fastened, also, to the horses of the
troopers. As they were dragged along, the cries and the
lamentations of Mary followed them; and the troopers
laughed at her wailing, or answered her cries with mockery,
till the sound of her grief became inaudible in the distance,
when again they imitated her cries, to harrow up the feelings
of her father.</p>

<p>Claverhouse, and a party of his troops, were then in the
neighbourhood of Traquair; and before that man, who
knew not what mercy was, John Brydone, and his son,
and the preacher were brought. It was on the afternoon
of the day following that on which they had been made
prisoners, that Claverhouse ordered them to be brought
forth. He was sitting, with wine before him, in the midst
of his officers; and amongst them was Lieutenant Mowbray,
whose name was alluded to by the sergeant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, knaves!&rdquo; began Claverhouse, &ldquo;ye have been
singing, praying, preaching, and holding conventicles.&mdash;Do
ye know how Grahame of Claverhouse rewards such rebels?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the prisoners entered, Lieutenant Mowbray turned
away his head, and placed his hand upon his brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said John, addressing Claverhouse, &ldquo;I&#8217;m neither
knave nor rebel&mdash;I hae lifted up my voice to the God o&#8217;
my faithers, according to my conscience; and, unworthy
as I am o&#8217; the least o&#8217; His benefits, for threescore years
and ten he has been my shepherd and deliverer, and, if it
be good in His sight, He will deliver me now. My trust
is in Him, and I fear neither the frown nor the sword o&#8217;
the persecutor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have done, grey-headed babbler!&rdquo; cried Claverhouse.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Mowbray, who still sat with his face from
the prisoners, raised his handkerchief to his eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said Mr. Duncan, &ldquo;there&#8217;s a day coming
when ye shall stand before the great Judge, as we now
stand before you; and when the remembrance o&#8217; this day,
and the blood o&#8217; the righteous which ye hae shed, shall be
written with letters o&#8217; fire on yer ain conscience, and recorded
against ye; and ye shall call upon the rocks and
mountains to cover ye&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; exclaimed Claverhouse. &ldquo;Away with them!&rdquo;
he added, waving his hand to his
troopers&mdash;&ldquo;shoot them before sunrise!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shortly after the prisoners had been conveyed from the
presence of Claverhouse, Lieutenant Mowbray withdrew;
and having sent for the soldier who had interfered on behalf
of Mary&mdash;&ldquo;Macdonald,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;you were present
yesterday when the prisoners, who are to die to-morrow,
were taken. Where did you find them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the old man&#8217;s house,&rdquo; replied the soldier; and he
related all that he had seen, and how he had interfered to
save the daughter. The heart of the officer was touched,
and he walked across his room, as one whose spirit was
troubled. &ldquo;You did well, Macdonald!&rdquo; said he, at
length&mdash;&ldquo;you did well!&rdquo; He was again silent, and again he
added&mdash;&ldquo;And you found the preacher in the old man&#8217;s
house&mdash;<em>you found</em> <span class="smcap">him</span> <em>there</em>!&rdquo; There was an
anxious wildness in the tone of the lieutenant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We found him there,&rdquo; replied the soldier.</p>

<p>The officer was again silent&mdash;again he thoughtfully paced
across the floor of his apartment. At length, turning to
the soldier, he added&mdash;&ldquo;I can trust you, Macdonald.
When night has set in, take your horse and ride to the
house of the elder prisoner, and tell his daughter&mdash;the
maiden whom you saved&mdash;to have horses in readiness for
her father, her brother, and&mdash;and her&mdash;her <em>husband!</em>&rdquo; said
the lieutenant, faltering as he spoke; and when he had
pronounced the word <em>husband</em>, he again paused, as though
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
his heart were full. The soldier was retiring&mdash;&ldquo;Stay,&rdquo;
added the officer, &ldquo;tell her, her father, her brother, and&mdash;the
preacher, shall not die; before daybreak she shall
see them again; and give her this ring as a token that ye
speak truly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took a ring from his finger, and gave it into the hands
of the soldier.</p>

<p>It was drawing towards midnight. The troops of Claverhouse
were quartered around the country, and his three
prisoners, still bound to each other, were confined in a
small farm-house, from which the inhabitants had been
expelled. They could hear the heavy and measured tread
of the sentinel pacing backward and forward in front of
the house; the sound of his footsteps seemed to measure
out the moments between them and eternity. After they
had sung a psalm and prayed together&mdash;&ldquo;I am auld,&rdquo; said
John Brydone, &ldquo;and I fear not to die, but rather glory to
lay down my life for the great cause; but, oh, Daniel! my
heart yearns that yer bluid also should be shed&mdash;had they
only spared ye, to hae been a protector to our puir Mary!&mdash;or
had I no driven Philip frae the house&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mention not the name of the cast-away,&rdquo; said the minister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dinna mourn, faither,&rdquo; answered Daniel, &ldquo;an arm mair
powerful than that of man will be her supporter and protector.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; responded Mr. Duncan. &ldquo;She has aye been
cauld to me, and has turned the ear o&#8217; the deaf adder to
the voice o&#8217; my affection; but even noo, when my thochts
should be elsewhere, the thocht o&#8217; her burns in my heart
like a coal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While they yet spoke, a soldier, wrapt up in a cloak,
approached the sentinel, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a cold night, brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Piercing,&rdquo; replied the other, striking his feet upon the
ground.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
&ldquo;You are welcome to a mouthful of my spirit-warmer,&rdquo;
added the first, taking a bottle from beneath his cloak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank ye!&rdquo; rejoined the sentinel; &ldquo;but I don&#8217;t know
your voice. You don&#8217;t belong to our corps, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the other; &ldquo;but it matters not for that&mdash;brother
soldiers should give and take.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sentinel took the bottle and raised it to his lips; he
drank, and swore the liquor was excellent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drink again,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;you are welcome; it
is as good as a double cloak around you.&rdquo; And the
sentinel drank again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night, comrade,&rdquo; said the trooper. &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo;
replied the sentinel; and the stranger passed on.</p>

<p>Within half an hour, the same soldier, still muffled up
in his cloak, returned. The sentinel had fallen against the
door of the house, and was fast asleep. The stranger proceeded
to the window&mdash;he raised it&mdash;he entered. &ldquo;Fear nothing,&rdquo;
he whispered to the prisoners, who were bound
to staples that had been driven into the opposite wall of
the room. He cut the cords with which their hands and
their feet were fastened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven reward ye for the mercy o&#8217; yer heart, and the
courage o&#8217; this deed,&rdquo; said John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say nothing,&rdquo; whispered their deliverer, &ldquo;but follow me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Each man crept from the window, and the stranger
again closed it behind them. &ldquo;Follow me, and speak not,&rdquo;
whispered he again; and, walking at his utmost
speed, he conducted them for several miles across the hills;
but still he spoke not. Old John marvelled at the manner
of their deliverer; and he marvelled yet more when he
led them to Philiphaugh, and to the very spot where, more
than thirty years before, he had found the child on the
bosom of its dead mother; and there the stranger stood
still, and, turning round to those he had delivered&mdash;&ldquo;Here
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
we part,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;hasten to your own house, but tarry
not. You will find horses in readiness, and flee into
Westmoreland; inquire there for the person to whom this
letter is addressed; he will protect you.&rdquo; And he put a
sealed letter into the hands of the old man, and, at the
same time, placed a purse in the hands of Daniel, saying,
&ldquo;This will bear your expenses by the way&mdash;Farewell!&mdash;farewell!&rdquo;
They would have detained him, but he
burst away, again exclaiming, as he ran&mdash;&ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a marvellous deliverance,&rdquo; said John; &ldquo;it is a
mystery, an&#8217; for him to leave us on this spot&mdash;on <em>this very
spot</em>&mdash;where puir Philip&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash; And here the heart of the
old man failed him.</p>

<p>We need not describe the rage of Claverhouse, when he
found, on the following day, that the prisoners had escaped;
and how he examined and threatened the sentinels with
death, and cast suspicious glances upon Lieutenant Mowbray;
but he feared to accuse him, or quarrel with him openly.</p>

<p>As John, with the preacher and his son, approached the
house, Mary heard their footsteps, rushed out to meet
them, and fell weeping upon her father&#8217;s neck. &ldquo;My bairn!&rdquo;
cried the old man; &ldquo;we are restored to ye as
from the dead! Providence has dealt wi&#8217; us in mercy an&#8217;
in mystery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His four farm-horses were in readiness for their flight;
and Mary told him how the same soldier who had saved
her from sharing their fate, had come to their house at
midnight, and assured her that they should not die, and to
prepare for their flight; &ldquo;and,&rdquo; added she, &ldquo;in token
that he who had sent him would keep his promise towards
you, he gave me this ring, requesting me to wear it for
your deliverer&#8217;s sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Philip&#8217;s ring!&rdquo; cried the old man, striking his
hand before his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;it is Philip&#8217;s ring!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
&ldquo;<em>My</em> Philip&#8217;s!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary; &ldquo;oh, then, he lives!&mdash;he lives!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The preacher leaned his brow against the walls of the
cottage and groaned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is still a mystery,&rdquo; said the old man, yet pressing
his hands before his eyes in agony; &ldquo;but it is&mdash;it maun
be him. It was Philip that saved us&mdash;that conducted us
to the very spot where I found him! But, oh,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;I wad rather I had died, than lived to ken that he has
drawn his sword in the ranks o&#8217; the oppressor, and to murder
the followers after the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dinna think that o&#8217; him, father!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mary; &ldquo;Philip wadna&mdash;he couldna draw his sword but
to defend the helpless!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Knowing that they had been pursued and sought after,
they hastened their flight to England, to seek the refuge
to which their deliverer had directed them. But as they
drew near to the Borders, the Rev. Mr. Duncan suddenly
exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Now, here we must part&mdash;part for ever!
It is not meet that I should follow ye farther. When the
sheep are pursued by the wolves, the shepherd should not
flee from them. Farewell, dear friends&mdash;and, oh! farewell
to you, Mary! Had it been sinful to hae loved you, I
would hae been a guilty man this day&mdash;for, oh! beyond a&#8217;
that is under the sun, ye hae been dear to my heart, and
your remembrance has mingled wi&#8217; my very devotions.
But I maun root it up, though, in so doing, I tear my very
heart-strings. Fareweel!&mdash;fareweel! Peace be wi&#8217; you&mdash;and
may ye be a&#8217; happier than will ever be the earthly
lot o&#8217; Andrew Duncan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tears fell upon Mary&#8217;s cheeks; for, though she
could not love, she respected the preacher, and she
esteemed him for his worth. Her father and brother
entreated him to accompany them. &ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; he
answered; &ldquo;I see how this flight will end. Go&mdash;there is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
happiness in store for you; but my portion is with the
dispersed and the persecuted.&rdquo; And he turned and left
them.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Mowbray was disgusted with the cold-blooded
butchery of the service in which he was engaged; and, a
few days after the escape of John Brydone and his son, he
threw up his commission, and proceeded to Dumfriesshire.
It was a Sabbath evening, and near nightfall; he had
wandered into the fields alone, for his spirit was heavy.
Sounds of rude laughter broke upon his ear; and, mingled
with the sound of mirth, was a voice as if in earnest
prayer. He hurried to a small wood from whence the
sounds proceeded, and there he beheld four troopers, with
their pistols in their hands, and before them was a man,
who appeared to be a preacher, bound to a tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, old Psalmody!&rdquo; cried one of the troopers, raising
his pistol, and addressing their intended victim, who
was engaged in prayer; &ldquo;make ready&mdash;we have other jobs
on hand&mdash;and we gave you time to speak a prayer, but
not to preach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mowbray rushed forward. He sprang between the
troopers and their victim. &ldquo;Hold! ye murderers, hold!&rdquo;
he exclaimed. &ldquo;Is it thus that ye disgrace the name of
soldiers by washing your hands in the blood of the innocent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They knew Mowbray, and they muttered, &ldquo;You are no
officer of ours now; he is our prisoner, and our orders
ere to shoot every conventicle knave who falls into our
hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shame on him who would give such orders!&rdquo; said
Mowbray; &ldquo;and shame on those who would execute
them! There,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;there is money! I will ransom him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With an imprecation, they took the money that was
offered them, and left their prisoner to Mowbray. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
approached the tree where they had bound him&mdash;he started
back&mdash;it was the Rev. Andrew Duncan!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rash man!&rdquo; exclaimed Mowbray, as he again stepped
forward to unloose the cords that bound him. &ldquo;Why have
ye again cast yourself into the hands of the men who seek
your blood? Do you hold your life so cheap, that, in one
week, ye would risk to sell it twice? Why did not ye,
with your father, your brother, and your <em>wife</em>, flee into
England, where protection was promised!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father!&mdash;my brother!&mdash;my wife!&mdash;mine!&mdash;mine!&rdquo;
repeated the preacher wildly. &ldquo;There are no such names
for my tongue to utter!&mdash;none!&mdash;none to drop their
love as morning dew upon the solitary soul o&#8217; Andrew
Duncan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they murdered?&rdquo; exclaimed Mowbray, suddenly,
in a voice of agony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Murdered!&rdquo; said the preacher, with increased bewilderment.
&ldquo;What do you mean?&mdash;or wha&#8217; do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; cried Mowbray, eagerly; &ldquo;are not you the
husband of Mary Brydone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me!&mdash;me!&rdquo; cried the preacher. &ldquo;No!&mdash;no!&mdash;I loved
her as the laverock loves the blue lift in spring, and her
shadow cam between me and my ain soul&mdash;but she wadna
hearken unto my voice&mdash;she is nae wife o&#8217; mine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed Mowbray; and he clasped
his hands together.</p>

<p>It is necessary, however, that we now accompany John
Brydone and his family in their flight into Westmoreland.
The letter which their deliverer had put into their hands
was addressed to a Sir Frederic Mowbray; and, when they
arrived at the house of the old knight, the heart of the
aged Covenanter almost failed him for a moment; for it
was a proud-looking mansion, and those whom he saw
around wore the dress of the Cavaliers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
&ldquo;Who are ye?&rdquo; inquired the servant who admitted
them to the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deliver this letter into the hands of your master,&rdquo; said
the Covenanter; &ldquo;our business is with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the handwriting of Master Edward,&rdquo; said the
servant, as he took the letter into his hand; and, having
conducted them to a room, he delivered it to Sir Frederic.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the old knight hurried into the room,
where the Covenanter, and his son and his daughter, stood.
&ldquo;Welcome, thrice welcome!&rdquo; he cried, grasping the hand
of the old man; &ldquo;here you shall find a resting-place and
a home, with no one to make you afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ordered wine and food to be placed before them, and
he sat down with them.</p>

<p>Now John marvelled at the kindness of his host, and his
heart burned within him; and, in the midst of all, he
thought of the long-lost Philip, and how he had driven
him from his house&mdash;and his cheek glowed and his heart
throbbed with anxiety. His son marvelled also, and Mary&#8217;s
bosom swelled with strange thoughts&mdash;tears gathered in her
eyes, and she raised the ring that had been the token of
her father&#8217;s deliverance to her lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; said the Covenanter, &ldquo;pardon the freedom o&#8217;
a plain blunt man, and o&#8217; ane whose bosom is burning wi&#8217;
anxiety; but there is a mystery, there is <em>something</em> attending
my deliverance, an&#8217; the letter, and your kindness, that
I canna see through&mdash;and I hope, and I fear&mdash;and I canna&mdash;I
<em>daurna</em> comprehend how it is!&mdash;but, as it were, the
past&mdash;the lang bygane past, and the present, appear to hae
met thegither! It is makin&#8217; my head dizzy wi&#8217; wonder,
for there seems in a&#8217; this a something that concerns you,
and that concerns me, and <em>one</em> that I mayna name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your perplexity,&rdquo; said Sir Frederic, &ldquo;may be best
relieved, by stating to you, in a few words, one or two
circumstances of my history. Having, from family affliction,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
left this country, until within these four years, I held
a commission in the army of the Prince of Orange. I was
present at the battle of Seneff; it was my last engagement;
and in the regiment which I commanded, there was a young
Scottish volunteer, to whose bravery, during the battle, I
owed my life. In admiration and gratitude for his conduct,
I sent for him after the victory, to present him to the
prince. He came. I questioned him respecting his birth
and his family. He was silent&mdash;he burst into tears. I
urged him to speak. He said, of his real name he knew
nothing&mdash;of his family he knew nothing&mdash;all that he knew
was, that he had been the adopted son of a good and a
Christian man, who had found him on Philiphaugh, on the
lifeless bosom of his mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merciful Heaven! my puir, injured Philip!&rdquo; exclaimed
the aged Covenanter, wringing his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My brother!&rdquo; cried Daniel eagerly. Mary wept.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir!&rdquo; continued Sir Frederic, &ldquo;words cannot paint
my feelings as he spoke! I had been at the battle of
Philiphaugh! and, not dreaming that a conflict was at
hand, my beloved wife, with our infant boy, my little
Edward, had joined me but the day before. At the first
noise of Lesly&#8217;s onset, I rushed from our tent&mdash;I left my
loved ones there! Our army was stricken with confusion&mdash;I
never beheld them again! I grasped the hand of the
youth&mdash;I gazed in his face as though my soul would have
leaped from my eyelids. &lsquo;Do not deceive me!&rsquo; I cried;
and he drew from his bosom the ring and the bracelets of
my Elizabeth!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the old knight paused and wept, and tears ran
down the cheeks of John Brydone, and the cheeks of his
children.</p>

<p>They had not been many days in Westmoreland, and
they were seated around the hospitable hearth of the good
knight in peace, when two horsemen arrived at the door.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
&ldquo;It is our friend, Mr. Duncan, and a stranger!&rdquo; said
the Covenanter, as he beheld them from the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are welcome&mdash;for your sake, they are welcome,&rdquo;
said Sir Frederic; and while he yet spoke, the strangers
entered. &ldquo;My son, my son!&rdquo; he continued, and hurried
forward to meet him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say also your <em>daughter</em>!&rdquo; said Edward Mowbray, as he
approached towards Mary, and pressed her to his breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Philip!&mdash;my own Philip!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary, and speech
failed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My brother!&rdquo; said Daniel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was dead, and is alive again&mdash;he was lost, and is
found,&rdquo; exclaimed John. &ldquo;O, Philip, man! do ye forgi&#8217;e me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The adopted son pressed the hand of his foster-father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is enough,&rdquo; replied the Covenanter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he forgives you!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Duncan; &ldquo;and
he has forgiven me. When we were in prison and in bonds
waiting for death, he risked his life to deliver us, and he
did deliver us; and a second time he has rescued me from
the sword of the destroyer, and from the power of the men
who thirsted for my blood. He is no enemy o&#8217; the Covenant&mdash;he
is the defender o&#8217; the persecuted; and the blessing
o&#8217; Andrew Duncan is all he can bequeath, for a life
twice saved, upon his deliverer, and Mary Brydone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Need we say that Mary bestowed her hand upon Edward
Mowbray? but, in the fondness of her heart, she still called
him &ldquo;her Philip!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE FORTUNES OF WILLIAM WIGHTON.</h2>


<p>My departure from Edinburgh was sudden and mysterious;
and it was high time that I was away, for I was but a
reckless boy at the best. My uncle was both sore vexed
and weary of me, for I was never out of one mishap until
I was into another; but one illumination night in the city
put them all into the rear&mdash;I had, by it, got far ahead of
all my former exploits. Very early next morning, I got
notice from a friend that the bailies were very desirous of
an interview with me; and, to do me more honour, I was
to be escorted into their presence. I had no inclination
for such honour, particularly at this time. I saw that our
discourse could not be equally agreeable to both parties;
besides they, I knew, would put questions to me I could
not well answer to their satisfaction&mdash;though, after all,
there was more of devilry than roguery in anything I had
been engaged in.</p>

<p>I was not long in making up my mind; for I saw
Archibald Campbell and two of the town-guard at the
head of the close as I stepped out at the stair-foot. I had
no doubt that I was the person they wished to honour with
their accompaniment to the civic authorities. I was out
at the bottom of the close like thought. I believe they
never got sight of me. I kept in hiding all day&mdash;neither
my uncle nor any of my friends knew where I was to be
found. After it was dark, I ventured into town; but no
farther than the Low Calton, where dwelt an old servant
of my father&#8217;s, who had been my nurse after the death of
my mother. She was a widow, and lived in one of the
ground flats, where she kept a small retail shop. Poor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
creature! she loved me as if I had been her own child,
and wept when I told her the dilemma I was in. She
promised to conceal me until the storm blew over, and to
make my peace once more with my uncle, if I would
promise to be a good boy in future. She made ready for
me a comfortable supper, and a bed in her small back
room. Weary sitting alone, I went to rest, and soon fell
into a sound sleep. I had lain thus, I know not how long,
when I was roused by a loud noise, as if some person or
persons had fallen on the floor above; and voices in angry
altercation struck my ear.</p>

<p>The weather being cold, my nurse had put on a fire in
the grate, which still burned bright, and gave the room a
cheerful appearance. I looked up&mdash;the angry voices continued,
and there was a continued beating upon the floor
at intervals, and, apparently, a great struggling, as if two
people were engaged in wrestling. I attempted to fall
asleep again, but in vain. For half an hour there had
been little intermission of the noise. The ceiling of the
room was composed only of the flooring of the story above;
so that the thumping and scuffling were most annoying,
reminding one of the sound of a drum overhead. I rose
in anger from my bed, and, seizing the poker, beat up
upon the ceiling pretty smartly. The sound ceased for a
short space, and I crept into bed again. I was just on the
point of falling asleep when the beating and struggling
were renewed, and with them my anger. I rose from bed
in great fury, resolved at least to make those who annoyed
me rise from the floor. I looked round for something
sharp, to prick them through the joinings of the flooring-deals.
By bad luck, I found upon the mantel-piece an
old worn knife, with a thin and sharp point. I mounted
upon the table, and thus reached the ceiling with my
hand. The irritating noise seemed to increase. I placed
the point in one of the joints, and gave a push up&mdash;it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
would not enter. I exerted my strength, when&mdash;I shall
never forget that moment&mdash;it ran up to the hilt!&mdash;a heavy
groan followed; I drew it back covered with blood! I
stood upon the table stupified with horror, gazing upon
the ensanguined blade; two or three heavy drops of blood
fell upon my face and went into my eyes. I leaped from
the table, and placed the knife where I had found it. The
noise ceased; but heavy drops of blood continued to fall
and coagulate upon the floor at my feet. I felt stupified
with fear and anguish&mdash;my eyes were riveted upon the
blood which&mdash;drop, drop, drop&mdash;fell upon the floor. I
had stood thus for some time before the danger I was in
occurred to me. I started, hastily put on my clothes, and,
opening the window, leapt out, fled by the back of the
houses, past the Methodist chapel, up the back stairs into
Shakspeare square, and along Princes&#8217; street; nor did I
slacken my pace until I was a considerable way out of town.</p>

<p>I was now miserable. The night was dark as a dungeon;
but not half so dark as my own thoughts. I had deprived
a fellow-creature of life! In vain did I say to myself that
it was done with no evil intention on my part. I had
been too rash in using the knife; and my conscience was
against me. I was at this very time, also, in hiding for
my rashness and folly in other respects. I trembled at
the first appearance of day, lest I should be apprehended
as a murderer. Dawn found me in the neighbourhood of
Bathgate. Cold and weary as I was, I dared not approach
a house or the public road, but lay concealed in a wood
all day, under sensations of the utmost horror. Towards
evening, I cautiously emerged from my hiding-place.
Compelled by hunger, I entered a lonely house at a
distance from the public road, and, for payment, obtained
some refreshment, and got my benumbed limbs warmed.
During my stay, I avoided all unnecessary conversation.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
I trembled lest they would speak of the murder in Edinburgh;
for, had they done so, my agitation must have
betrayed me. After being refreshed, I left the hospitable
people, and pursued, under cover of the night, my route
to Glasgow, which I reached a short time after daybreak.
Avoiding the public streets, I entered the first
change-house I found open at this early hour, where I
obtained a warm breakfast and a bed, of both which I
stood greatly in need. I soon fell asleep, in spite of the
agitation of my mind; but my dreams were far more
horrifying than my waking thoughts, dreadful as they
were. I awoke early in the afternoon, feverish and unrefreshed.</p>

<p>After some time spent in summoning up resolution, I
requested my landlady to procure for me a sight of any of
the Edinburgh newspapers of the day before. She brought
one to me. My agitation was so great that I dared not
trust myself to take it out of her hand, lest she had perceived
the tremor I was in; but requested her to lay it
down, while I appeared to be busy adjusting my dress&mdash;carefully,
all the time, keeping my back to her. I had
two objects in view: I wished to see the shipping-list, as
it was my aim to leave the country for America by the
first opportunity; and, secondly, to see what account the
public had got of my untoward adventure. I felt conscious
that all the city was in commotion about it, and the
authorities despatched for my apprehension; for I had no
doubt that my nurse would at once declare her innocence,
and tell who had done the deed. With an anxiety I want
words to express, I grasped the paper as soon as the landlady
retired, and hurried over its columns until I reached
the last. During the interval, I believe I scarcely
breathed; I looked it over once more with care; I felt
as if a load had been lifted from my breast&mdash;there was not
in the whole paper a single word of a death by violence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
or accident. I thought it strange, but rejoiced. I felt
that I was not in such imminent danger of being apprehended;
but my mind was still racked almost to distraction.</p>

<p>I remained in my lodging for several days, very ill,
both from a severe cold I had caught and distress of mind.
I had seen every paper during the time. Still there was
nothing in them applicable to my case. I was bewildered,
and knew not what to think. Had the occurrences of that
fearful night, I thought, been only a delusion&mdash;some
horrid dream or nightmare? Alas! the large drops of
blood that still stained my shirt, which, in my confusion,
I had not changed, drove from my mind the consoling
hope; they were damning evidence of a terrible reality.
My mind reverted back to its former agony, which became
so aggravated by the silence of the public prints that I
was rendered desperate. The silence gave a mystery to
the whole occurrence, more unendurable than if I had
found it narrated in the most aggravated language, and
my person described, with a reward for my apprehension.</p>

<p>As soon as my sickness had a little abated, and I was
able to go out, I went in the evening, a little before ten
o&#8217;clock, to the neighbourhood of where the coach from
Edinburgh stopped. I walked about until its arrival,
shunning observation as much as possible. At length it
came. No one descended from it whom I recollected ever
to have seen. Rendered desperate, I followed two travellers
into a public-house which they entered, along with
the guard. For some time, I sat an attentive listener to
their conversation. It was on indifferent subjects; and I
watched an opportunity to join in their talk. Speaking
with an air of indifference, I turned the conversation to
the subject I had so much at heart&mdash;the local news of the
city. They gave me what little they had; but not one
word of it concerned my situation. I inquired at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
guard if he would, next morning, be so kind as take a
letter to Edinburgh, for Widow Neil, in the Low Calton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;I know her well, as I live
close by her shop; but, poor woman, she has been very
unwell for these two or three days past. There has been
some strange talk of a young lad who vanished from her
house, no one can tell how; she is likely to get into
trouble from the circumstance, for it is surmised he has
been murdered in her house, and his body carried off, as
there was a quantity of blood upon the floor. No one
suspects her of it; but still it is considered strange that
she should have heard no noise, and can give no account
of the affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This statement of the guard surprised me exceedingly.
Why was the affair mentioned in so partial and unsatisfactory
a manner? Why was I, a murderer, suspected of
being myself murdered? Why did not this lead to an
investigation, which must have exposed the whole horrid
mystery of the death of the individual up stairs? I could
not understand it. My mind became the more perplexed,
the more I thought of it. Yet, so far, I had no reason to
complain. Nothing had been said in any respect implicating
me. Perhaps I had killed nobody; perhaps I had
only wounded some one who did not know whence the
stab came; or perhaps the person killed or wounded was
an outlaw, and no discovery could be made of his situation.
All these thoughts rushed through my mind as I
sat beside the men. I at last left them, being afraid to
put further questions.</p>

<p>I went to my lodgings and considered what I should do.
I conceived it safest to write no letters to my friends, or
say anything further on the subject. I meditated upon
the propriety of going to America, and had nearly made
up my mind to that step. Every day, the mysterious
affair became more and more disagreeable and painful to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
me. I gave up making further inquiries, and even carefully
avoided, for a time, associating with any person or
reading any newspaper. I gradually became easier, as
time, which brought no explanation to me, passed over;
but the thought still lay at the bottom of my heart, that
I was a murderer.</p>

<p>I went one day to a merchant&#8217;s counting-house, to take
my passage for America. The man looked at me attentively.
I shook with fear, but he soon relieved me by
asking&mdash;&ldquo;Why I intended to leave so good a country for
so bad a one?&rdquo; I replied, that I could get no employment
here. My appearance had pleased him. He offered
me a situation in his office. I accepted it. I continued
in Glasgow, happy and respected, for several years, and, to
all likelihood, was to have settled there for life. I was
on the point of marriage with a young woman, as I
thought, every way worthy of the love I had for her.
Her parents were satisfied; the day of our nuptials was
fixed&mdash;the house was taken and furnished wherein we
were to reside, and everything prepared. In the delirium
of love, I thought myself the happiest of men, and even
forgot the affair of the murder.</p>

<p>It was on the Monday preceding our union&mdash;which was
to take place in her father&#8217;s house on the Friday evening&mdash;that
business of the utmost importance called me to the
town of Ayr. I took a hasty farewell of my bride, and
set off, resolved to be back upon the Thursday at farthest.
Early in the forenoon of Tuesday, I got everything
arranged to my satisfaction; but was too late for the first
coach. To amuse myself in the best manner I could,
until the coach should set off again, I wandered down to
the harbour; and, while there, it was my misfortune to
meet an old acquaintance, Alexander Cameron, the son of
a barber in the Luckenbooths. Glad to see each other,
we shook hands most cordially; and, after chatting about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
&ldquo;auld langsyne&rdquo; until we were weary wandering upon the
pier, I proposed to adjourn to my inn. To this proposal
he at once acceded, on condition that I should go on board
of his vessel afterwards, when he would return the visit in
the evening. To this I had no objection to make. The
time passed on until the dusk. We left the inn; but, instead
of proceeding to the harbour, we struck off into the
country for some time, and then made the coast at a small
bay, where I could just discern, through the twilight, a
small lugger-rigged vessel at anchor. I felt rather uneasy,
and began to hesitate; when my friend, turning round, said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is my vessel, and as fine a crew mans her as ever
walked a deck;&mdash;we will be on board in a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wished, yet knew not how, to refuse. He made a loud
call; a boat with two men pushed from under a point, and
we were rowing towards the vessel ere I could summon
resolution to refuse. I remained on board not above an
hour. I was treated in the most kindly manner. When
I was coming away, Cameron said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have requested this visit from the confidence I feel
in your honour. I ask you not, to promise not to deceive
me&mdash;I am sure you will not. My time is very uncertain
upon this coast, and I have papers of the utmost importance,
which I wish to leave in safe hands. We are too
late to arrange them to-night; but be so kind as promise
to be at the same spot where we embarked to-morrow
morning, at what hour you please, and I will deliver them
to you. Should it ever be in my power to serve you, I
will not flinch from the duty of gratitude, cost what it
may.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a something so sincere and earnest in his
manner, that I could not refuse. I said, that as I left Ayr
on the morrow, I would make it an early hour&mdash;say, six
o&#8217;clock; which pleased him. We shook hands and parted,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
when I was put on shore, and returned to my inn, where I
ruminated upon what the charge could be I was going to
receive from my old friend in so unexpected a manner.</p>

<p>I was up betimes, and at the spot by the appointed hour.
The boat was in waiting; but Cameron was not with her.
I was disappointed, and told one of the men so; he replied
that the captain expected me on board to breakfast. With
a reluctance much stronger than I had felt the preceding
night, I consented to go on board. I found him in the
cabin, and the breakfast ready for me. We sat down, and
began to converse about the papers. Scarce was the second
cup filled out, when a voice called down the companion,
&ldquo;Captain, the cutter!&rdquo; Cameron leaped from the table,
and ran on deck. I heard a loud noise of cordage and
bustle; but could not conceive what it was, until the
motion of the vessel too plainly told that she was under
way. I rose in haste to get upon deck; but the cover
was secured. I knocked and called; but no one paid any
attention to my efforts. I stood thus knocking, and calling
at the stretch of my voice, for half an hour, in vain.
I returned to my seat, and sat down, overcome with
anger and chagrin. Here was I again placed in a disagreeable
dilemma&mdash;evidently going far out to sea, when
I ought to be on my way to Glasgow to my wedding. In
the middle of my ravings, I heard first one shot, then
another; but still the ripple of the water and the noise
overhead continued. I was now convinced that I was on
board of a smuggling lugger, and that Cameron was either
sole proprietor or captain. I wished with all my heart
that the cutter might overtake and capture us, that I
might be set ashore; but all my wishes were vain&mdash;we
still held on our way at a furious rate. As I heard no
more shots, I knew that we had left the cutter at a greater
distance. Again, therefore, I strove to gain a hearing,
but in vain: I then strove to force the hatch, but it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
resisted all my efforts. I yielded myself at length to
my fate; for the way of the vessel was not in the least
abated.</p>

<p>Towards night, I could find, by the pitching of the
vessel and the increased noise above, that the wind had
increased fearfully, and that it blew a storm. It was with
difficulty that I could keep my seat, so much did she
pitch. During the whole night and following day, I was
so sick that I thought I would have died. I had no light;
there was no human creature to give me a mouthful of
water; and I could not help myself even to rise from the
floor of the cabin, on which I had sunk. The agony of
my mind was extreme: the day following was to have been
that of my marriage; I was at sea, and knew not where
I was. I blamed myself for my easy, complying temper;
my misery increased; and, could I have stood on my feet,
I know not what I might have done in my desperate
situation. Thus I spent a second night; and the day
which I had thought was to shine on my happiness,
dawned on my misery.</p>

<p>Towards the afternoon, the motion of the vessel ceased,
and I heard the anchor drop. Immediately the hatch was
opened, and Cameron came to me. I rose in anger, so
great that I could not give it utterance. Had I not been
so weak from sickness, I would have flown and strangled
him. He made a thousand apologies for what had happened.
I saw that his concern was real; my anger
subsided into melancholy, and my first utterance was
employed to inquire where we were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to say,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;that I cannot but feel
really grieved to inform you that we are at present a few
leagues off Flushing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; I exclaimed, as I buried my face in my
hands, while I actually wept for shame&mdash;&ldquo;I am utterly
undone! What will my beloved Eliza say? How shall
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
I ever appear again before her and her friends? Even
now, perhaps, she is dressing to be my wife, or weeping
in the arms of her bridesmaid. The thought will drive
me mad. For Godsake, Cameron, get under way, and
land me again either at Greenock or where you first took
me up, or I am utterly undone. Do this, and I will forget
all I have suffered and am suffering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would, upon my soul,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;were it in my
power, though I should die in a jail; but, while this gale
lasts, it were folly to attempt it. Besides, I am not sole
proprietor of the lugger&mdash;I am only captain. My crew
are sharers in the cargo. I would not get their consent.
The thought of the evil I was unintentionally doing you,
gave me more concern than the fear of capture. Had the
storm not come on, I would have risked all to have landed
you somewhere in Scotland; but it was so severe, and
blowing from the land, that there was no use to attempt it.
I hope, however, the weather will now moderate, and the
wind shift, when I will run you back, or procure you a
passage in the first craft that leaves for Scotland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I made no answer to him, I was so absorbed in my own
reflections. I walked the deck like one distracted, praying
for a change in the weather. For another three days it blew,
with less or more violence, from the same point&mdash;during
which time I scarcely ever ate or drank, and never went
to bed. On the forenoon of Monday, the wind shifted.
I went immediately ashore in the boat, and found a brig
getting under way for Leith. I stepped on board, and
took farewell of Captain Cameron, whom I never saw
again, and wish I had never seen him in my life.</p>

<p>After a tedious passage of nine days, during which we
had baffling winds and calms, we reached Leith Roads
about seven in the evening. It was low water, and the
brig could not enter the harbour for several hours. I was
put ashore in the boat, and hastened up to the Black Bull
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
Inn, in order to secure a seat in the mail for Glasgow,
which was to start in a few minutes. As I came up Leith
Walk, my feelings became of a mixed nature. I thought
of Widow Niel and the murder, as I looked over at the
Calton; then my mind reverted to my bride. I got into
the coach, and was soon on the way to Glasgow. I laid
myself back in a corner, and kept a stubborn silence. I
could not endure to enter into conversation with my
fellow-travellers: I scarce heard them speak&mdash;my mind
was so distracted by what had befallen me, and what
might be the result.</p>

<p>Pale, weary, and exhausted, I reached my lodgings
between three and four o&#8217;clock of the morning of the
seventeenth day from that in which I had left it in joy
and hope. After I had knocked, and was answered, my
landlady almost fainted at the sight of me. She had
believed me dead; and my appearance was not calculated
to do away the impression, I looked so ghastly from
anxiety and the want of sleep. Her joy was extreme
when she found her mistake. I undressed and threw
myself on my bed, where I soon fell into a sound sleep,
the first I had enjoyed since my involuntary voyage.</p>

<p>I did not awake until about eight o&#8217;clock, when I arose
and dressed. I did not haste to Eliza, as my heart urged
me, lest my sudden appearance should have been fatal to
her. I wrote her a note, informing her I was in health,
and would call and explain all after breakfast. I sent off
my card, and immediately waited upon my employers.
They were more surprised than pleased at my return.
Another had been placed in my situation, and they did
not choose to pay him off when I might think proper to
return after my unaccountable absence. My soul fired at
the base insinuation; my voice rose, as I demanded to
know if they doubted my veracity. With an expression
of countenance that spoke daggers, one of them said&mdash;&ldquo;We
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
doubt, at least, your prudence in going on board an
unknown vessel; but let us proceed to business&mdash;we have
found all your books correct to a farthing, and here is an
order for your salary up to your leaving. Good morning!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I received it indignantly; and, bowing stiffly, left them.
I was not much cast down at this turn my affairs had taken
so unexpectedly. I had no doubt of finding a warm reception
from Eliza, hurried to her parent&#8217;s house, and
rung the bell for admittance. Judge my astonishment
when her brother opened the door, with a look as if we
had never met, and inquired what I wanted. The blood
mounted to my face&mdash;I essayed to speak; but my tongue
refused its office; I felt bewildered, and stood more like
a statue than a man. In the most insulting manner, he
said&mdash;&ldquo;There is no one here who wishes any intercourse
with you.&rdquo; And he shut the door upon me.</p>

<p>Of everything that befell me for a length of time, from
this moment, I am utterly unconscious; when I again
awoke to consciousness, I was in bed at my lodgings, with
my kind landlady seated at my bedside. I was so weak
and reduced I could scarce turn myself; the agitation I
had undergone, and the cruel receptions I had met on my
return, had been too much for my mind to bear; a brain
fever had been the consequence, and my life had been
despaired of for several days. I would have questioned my
landlady; but she urged silence upon me, and refused to
answer my inquiries. I soon after learned all. I had
been utterly neglected by those to whom I might have
looked for aid or consolation; but the bitterest thought of
all was, that Eliza should cast me off without inquiry or
explanation. I could not bring my mind to believe she
did so of her own accord. She must, I thought, be either
cruelly deceived or under restraint; for she and her friends
could not but know the situation I was in. I vainly strove
to call my wounded pride to my aid, and drive her from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
my thoughts; but the more I strove, the firmer hold she
took of me. As soon as I could hold my pen, I wrote to
her in the most moving terms; and, after stating the whole
truth and what I had suffered, begged an interview, were
it to be our last&mdash;for my life or death, I said, appeared
to depend upon her answer. In the afternoon I received
one: it was my own letter, which had been opened, and
enclosed in an envelope. The writing was in her own
hand. Cruel woman! all it contained was, that she had
read, and now returned my letter as of her own accord,
and by the approbation of her friends; for she was firmly
resolved to have no communication with one who had
used her so cruelly, and exposed her to the ridicule of her
friends and acquaintances. This unjust answer had quite
an opposite effect from what I could have conceived a few
hours before; pity and contempt for the fickle creature
took the place of love; my mind became once more tranquil;
I recovered rapidly, and soon began to walk about
and enjoy the sweets of summer. I met my fickle fair by
accident more than once in my walks, and found I could
pass her as if we had never met. Her brother I had often
a mind to have horsewhipped; but the thought that I would
only give greater publicity to my unfortunate adventure,
and be looked upon as the guilty aggressor, prevented me
from gratifying my wish.</p>

<p>Glasgow had now become hateful to me, otherwise I
would have commenced manufacturer upon my own
account, as was my intention had I married Eliza. In as
short a period as convenient, I sold off the furniture of the
house I had taken, at little or no loss, and found that I
still was master of a considerable sum. Having made a
present to my landlady for her care of me, I bade a long
adieu to Glasgow, and proceeded by the coach to Leeds,
where I procured a situation in a house with which our
Glasgow house had had many transactions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
As I fear I am getting prolix, I shall hurry over the next
few years I remained in Leeds. I became a partner of
the house; our transactions were very extensive, more
particularly in the United States of America, where we
were deeply engaged in the cotton trade. It was judged
necessary that one of the firm should be on the spot, to
extend the business as much as possible. The others
being married men, I at once volunteered to take this
department upon myself, and made arrangements accordingly.
I proceeded towards Liverpool by easy stages on
horseback, as the coaches at that period were not so
regular as they are at present.</p>

<p>On the second day after my leaving Leeds, the afternoon
became extremely wet towards evening; so that I resolved
to remain all night in the first respectable inn I came to.
I dismounted, and found it completely filled with travellers,
who had arrived a short time before. It was with considerable
difficulty I prevailed upon the hostess to allow
me to remain. She had not a spare bed; all had been
already engaged; the weather continued still wet and boisterous,
and I resolved to proceed no farther that night,
whether I could obtain a bed or not. I, at length, arranged
with her that I should pass the night by the fireside, seated
in an arm-chair. Matters were thus all set to rights, and
supper over, when a loud knocking was heard at the door.
An additional stranger entered the kitchen where I sat,
drenched with rain and benumbed with cold; and, after
many difficulties upon the side of the hostess, the same
arrangements were made for him.</p>

<p>As our situations were so similar, we soon became very
intimate. I felt much interest in him. He was of a frank
and lively turn in conversation, and exceedingly well
informed on every subject we started. A shrewd eccentricity
in the style and matter of his remarks, forced the
conviction upon his hearers, that he was a man of no mean
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
capacity; there was also a restless inquietude in his manner,
which gave him the appearance of having a slight shade
of insanity. At one time his bright black eye was lighted
up with joy and hilarity, as he chanted a few lines of some
convivial song. In a few minutes, a change came over
him, and furtive, timid glances stole from under his long
dark eyelashes. Then would follow a glance so fierce, that
it required a firm mind to endure it unmoved. These
looks became more frequent as his libations continued;
for he had consumed a great quantity of liquor, and seemed
to me to be in that frame of mind when one strives in vain
to forget his identity.</p>

<p>The other inmates of the house had long retired, and all
was hushed save the voice of my companion. I felt no
inclination to sleep; the various scenes of my life were
floating over my mind, as I gazed into the bright fire that
glowed before me, while the storm raged without. My
companion had at length sunk into a troubled slumber;
his head resting upon his hand, which was supported by
the table, and his intelligent face half turned from me.
While I sat thus, my attention was roused by a low, indistinct
murmuring from the sleeper: he was evidently dreaming&mdash;for,
although there were a few disjointed words here
and there pronounced, he still slept soundly.</p>

<p>Gradually his articulation became more distinct and his
countenance animated; but his eyes were closed. I became
much interested; for this was the first instance of a dreamer
talking in his sleep I had ever witnessed. I watched him.
A gleam of joy and pleasure played around his well-formed
mouth, while the few inarticulate sounds he uttered resembled
distant shouts of youthful glee. Gradually the tones
became connected sentences; care and anxiety, at times,
came over his countenance; in heart-touching language, he
bade farewell to his parent and the beloved scenes of his
youth; large drops of moisture stole from under his closed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
eyelids. The transitions of his mind were so quick, that
it required my utmost attention to follow them; but I never
heard such true eloquence as came from this dreamer. I
had seen most of the performers of our modern stage, and
appreciated their talents; but what I at this time witnessed,
in the actings of genuine nature, surpassed all their efforts.</p>

<p>Gradually the shades of innocence departed from his
countenance; his language became adulterated by slang
phrases, and his features assumed a fiendish cast that made
me shudder. He showed that he was familiar with the
worst of company; care and anxiety gradually crept over
his countenance; he had, it seemed, commenced a system
of fraud upon his employers and been detected; grief and
despair threw over him their frightful shadows; pale and
dejected, he pleaded for mercy, for the sake of his father,
in the most abject terms. He now spoke with energy and
connection&mdash;it was to his companions in jail; but hope
had fled, and a shameful death seemed to him inevitable.</p>

<p>His trial came on. He proceeded to court&mdash;his lips
appeared pale and parched&mdash;a convulsive quiver agitated
the lower muscles of his face and neck&mdash;he seemed to
breathe with difficulty&mdash;his head sank lower upon the
hand that supported it&mdash;he had been condemned&mdash;he was
now in his solitary cell&mdash;his murmurs breathed repentance
and devotion&mdash;his sufferings appeared to be so intense that
large drops of perspiration stood upon his forehead&mdash;he
was engaged with the clergyman, preparing for death.
Remembering what I had suffered in my own dreams, I
resolved to awake him, and, to do so, gave the arm that
lay upon the table a gentle shake. A shudder passed over
his frame, and he sank upon the floor.</p>

<p>All that I have narrated had occurred in a space of time
remarkably short. I rose to lift him to his seat, and make
an apology for the surprise I had given him; but he was
quite unconscious. The noise of his fall had alarmed the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
landlady, who, with several of the guests, entered as I was
stooping with him in my arms, attempting to raise him. I
was so much shocked when I found the state he was in,
that I let him drop, and recoiled back in horror, exclaiming,
&ldquo;Good God! have I killed him! Send for a surgeon.&rdquo;
The idea that I had endeavoured to awake him
in an improper time came with strong conviction upon me,
and forced the words out of my mouth.</p>

<p>They raised him up and placed him on his seat. I could
not offer the smallest assistance. Every effort was used to
restore him in vain, and a surgeon sent for, but life had
fled. During all this time I had remained in a stupor of
mind; suspicion fell upon me that I had murdered him; I
had been alone with him, and seen stooping over the body
when they entered; and my exclamation at the time, and
my confusion, were all construed as sure tokens of my
guilt. I was strictly guarded until a coroner&#8217;s inquest
could be held upon the body.</p>

<p>I told the whole circumstances as they had occurred;
but my narrative made not the smallest impression. I was
not believed&mdash;an incredulous smile, or a dubious shake of
the head, was all that I obtained from my auditors. I
then kept silence, and refused to enter into any further
explanation, conscious that my innocence would be made
manifest at the inquest, which must meet as soon as the
necessary steps could be taken. I was already tried and
condemned by those around me&mdash;every circumstance was
turned against me, and the most prominent was that I was
Scotch. Many remarks were made, all to the prejudice of
my country, but aimed at me. My heart burned to retort
their unjust abuse; but I was too indignant to trust myself
to utter the thoughts that swelled my heart almost to
bursting.</p>

<p>The surgeon had come, and was busy examining the
body of the unfortunate individual, when a new traveller
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
arrived. He appeared to be about sixty years of age, of
a pleasing countenance, which was, however, shaded by
anxiety and grief. Sick and weary of those around me, I
had ceased to regard them, but I raised my eyes as the
new comer entered; and was at once struck by a strong
resemblance, as I thought, between him and the deceased.
The stranger appeared to take no interest in what was
going on, but urged the landlady to make haste and procure
him some refreshment, while his horse was being fed.
He was in the utmost hurry to depart, as important business
required his immediate attendance in London. The
loquacious landlady forced him to listen to a most exaggerated
account of the horrid murder which the Scotchman
had committed in her house. The story was so much distorted
by her inventions, that I could not have recognised
the event, if the time and place, and her often pointing to
me and the bed on which the body was laid, had not identified
it. I could perceive a faint shudder come over his
frame, as she finished her romance. The surgeon came
from his examination of the body. He was a man well
advanced in years, of an intelligent and benevolent cast of
countenance. She inquired with what instrument the
murder had been perpetrated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good lady,&rdquo; said the surgeon, &ldquo;I can find no
marks of violence upon the body, and I cannot say whether
the individual met his death by violence or the visitation
of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; cried the hostess, &ldquo;I am certain he was
murdered; for I saw them struggling on the floor as I
entered the room; and he said himself that he had murdered
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace, good woman,&rdquo; said the surgeon, who turned to
me, and requested to know the particulars from myself;
&ldquo;for I am persuaded,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that no outward
violence has been sustained by the deceased.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
I once more began to narrate to him the whole circumstance.
As I proceeded with the dream, the stranger suddenly
became riveted in his attention; his eyes were fixed
upon me; the muscles of his face were strangely agitated,
as if he was restraining some strong emotion; wonder and
anxiety were strongly expressed by turns, until I mentioned
one of the names I had heard in the dream. Uttering
a heart-rending groan, or rather scream, he rose from
his seat and staggered to the bed, where he fell upon the
inanimate body, and sobbed audibly as he kissed the cold
forehead, and parted the long brown hair that covered it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Charles,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;my son, my dear lost son!
have I found you thus, who was once the stay and hope
of my heart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was not a dry eye in the room after this burst of
agonized nature. He rose from the bed and approached
me. Looking mildly in my face, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stranger, be so good as to continue your account of this
sad accident; for both our sakes, I hope you are innocent
of any violence upon my son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Overcome by his manner, in kindness to him I suggested
that it would be better were only the surgeon and himself
present at the recital. Several of those present protested
loudly against my proposal, saying I would make my
escape if I was not guarded. My anger now rose&mdash;I could
restrain myself no longer&mdash;I cast an indignant glance
around, and, in a voice at its utmost pitch, dared any one
present to say I had used violence against the unfortunate
young man. All remained silent. In a calmer manner, I
declared I had no wish to depart, urgent as my business
was, until the inquest was over; and, if they doubted my
word, they were welcome to keep strict watch at the door
and windows.</p>

<p>The old man perceived the kindness of my motive for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
withdrawing with him, and his looks spoke his gratitude
as we retired.</p>

<p>I once more stated every circumstance as it had occurred,
from the time of his son&#8217;s arrival until he fell from the
chair. As I repeated the words I could make out in the
early part of the dream, his father wept like a child, and
said&mdash;&ldquo;Would to God he had never left me!&rdquo; When I
came to the London part, he groaned aloud and wrung
his hands. I was inclined more than once to stop; but he
motioned me to proceed, while tears choked his utterance.
When I had made an end, he clasped his hands, and,
raising his face to heaven, said&mdash;&ldquo;I thank Thee, Father of
mercies! Thy will be done. He was the last of five of
Thy gifts. I am now childless, and have nothing more
worth living for but to obey Thy will. I thank Thee that
in his last moments it can be said of him as it was of thy
apostle&mdash;&lsquo;Behold, he prayeth!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>For some time we remained silent, reverencing the old
man&#8217;s grief. The surgeon first broke silence:&mdash;&ldquo;Stranger,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;I have not a doubt of your innocence of any
intention to injure the person of the deceased, but your
humane intention to awaken him was certainly the immediate
cause of his death; for, had you tried to rouse
him from sleep, either sooner or later in his dream, all
might have been well. The gentle shake you gave his
arm, in all likelihood, was felt as the fatal fall of the platform
or push of the executioner, which caused, from
fright, a sudden collapse of the heart, that put a final stop
to the circulation and caused immediate death. We regret
it; but cannot say there was any bad intention on your part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thanked the surgeon for the justice he had done me
in his remarks; and then addressing the bereaved father,
I begged his forgiveness for my unfortunate interference
with his son; I only did so to put a period to his dream,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
as his sufferings appeared to me to be of the most acute
description.</p>

<p>He stretched out his hand, and grasping mine, which he
held for some time, while he strove to overcome his emotions,
he at length said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young man, from my heart I acquit you of every evil
intention, and believe you from evidence that cannot be
called in question. What you have told coincides with
facts I already possess. For some time back the conduct
of Charles gave me serious cause of uneasiness; but I
knew not half the extent of his excesses, although his
requests for money were incessant. I supplied them as
far as was in my power; for he accompanied them with
dutiful acknowledgments and plausible reasons. Until of
late I had fulfilled his every wish; but I found I could no
longer comply with prudence. Alas! you have let me at
length understand that the gaming-table was the gulf that
swallowed up all. I had for some time resolved to go
personally and reason with him upon the folly of his
extravagances; but, unfortunately, delayed it from day to day
and week to week. I felt it to be my duty as a parent;
but my heart shrunk from it. Fatal delay! Oh, that I
had done as my duty urged me!&rdquo; (Here his feelings
overpowered him for a few minutes.) &ldquo;Had I only gone
even a few days before I received that fatal letter that at
once roused me from my guilty supineness,&rdquo; (here he drew
a letter from his pocket and gave it me,) &ldquo;he might have
been saved! Read it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I complied. It was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Worthy Friend</span>,&mdash;I scarce know how to communicate
the information; but, I fear, no one here will do so
in so gentle a manner. Your son Charles, I am grieved
to say, has not been acting as I could have wished for this
some time back. One of the partners called here this morning
to inquire after him, as he had absconded from their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
service on account of some irregularity that had been discovered
in his cash entries, and made me afraid, by his
manner, that there might be something worse. Do, for
your own and his sake, come to town as quickly as possible.
In the meantime, I shall do all in my power to
avert any evil that may threaten.&mdash;Adieu!<br />
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 10em;">&ldquo;John Walker.&rdquo;</span></p></div>

<p>&ldquo;I was on my way,&rdquo; he proceeded, &ldquo;to save my poor
Charles from shame, had even the workhouse been my
only refuge at the close of my days. Alas! as he told in
his dream, I fear he had forfeited his life by that fatal act,
forgery, for which there is no pardon with man. If so, the
present dispensation is one of mercy, for which I bless His
name, who in all things doeth right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My heart ached for the pious old man. We left the
room, he leaning upon my arm. The surgeon and parent
both pronounced me innocent of the young man&#8217;s death.
Those who still remained in the house, more particularly
the hostess, appeared disappointed, and did not scruple to
hint their doubts. Until the coroner&#8217;s inquest sat, which
was in the afternoon, the father of the stranger never left
my side, but seemed to take a melancholy pleasure in
conversing about his son. The jury, after a patient investigation,
returned their verdict, &ldquo;Died by the visitation of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I immediately bade farewell to the surgeon and the
parent of the young man, and proceeded for Liverpool,
musing upon my strange destiny. It appeared to me that
I was haunted by some fatality, which plunged me constantly
into misfortune. I rejoiced that I was on the point
of leaving Britain, and hoped that in America I should be
freed from my bad fortune.</p>

<p>When I arrived in Liverpool I found the packet on the
eve of sailing; and, with all expedition, I made everything
ready and went on board. We were to sail with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
morning tide. There were a good many passengers; but
all of them appeared to be every-day personages&mdash;all less
or more studious about their own comforts. After an
agreeable voyage of five weeks, we arrived safe, and all in
good health, in Charleston. In a few months I completed
our arrangement satisfactorily, and began to make preparations
for my return to England again. A circumstance,
however, occurred, which overturned all my plans for a
time, and gave a new turn to my thoughts. Was it possible
that, after the way in which I had been cast off before
by one of the bewitching sex, I could ever do more than
look upon them again with indifference? I did not hate
or shun their company, but a feeling pretty much akin to
contempt, often stole over me as I recollected my old
injury. I could feel the sensation at times give way for a
few hours in the company of some females, and again
return with redoubled force upon the slightest occasion,
such as a single word or look. I was prejudiced, and
resolved not again to submit to the power of the sex.
But vain are the resolves of man. This continued struggle,
I really believe, was the reason of my again falling more
violently in love than ever, and that, too, against my own
will. When I strove to discover faults, I only found
perfections.</p>

<p>I had boarded in the house of a widow lady who had
three daughters, none of them exceeding twelve years of
age. A governess, one of the sweetest creatures that I
had ever seen, or shall ever see again, had the charge of
them. On the second evening after my arrival, I retired
to my apartment, overcome by heat and fatigue. I lay
listlessly thinking of Auld Reekie, the mysterious murder,
and all the strange occurrences of my past life. My attention
was awakened by a voice the sweetest I had ever
heard. I listened in rapture. It was only a few notes, as
the singer was trying the pitch of her voice, and soon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
ceased. I was wondering which of the family it could be
who sang so well, when I heard one of the daughters say,
&ldquo;Do, governess, sing me one song, and I will be a good
girl all to-morrow. Pray do!&rdquo; I became all attention&mdash;again
the voice fell upon my ear. It was low and plaintive&mdash;the
air was familiar to me&mdash;my whole soul became
entranced&mdash;the tear-drop swam in my eyes&mdash;it was one of
Scotland&#8217;s sweetest ditties&mdash;&ldquo;The Broom o&#8217; the Cowdenknowes.&rdquo;
No one who has not heard, unexpected, in a
foreign land the songs he loved in his youth, can appreciate
the thrill of pleasing ecstasy that carries the mind,
as it were, out of the body, when the ears catch the well-known
sounds.</p>

<p>Next day I was all anxiety to see the individual who
had so fascinated me the evening before. I found her all
that my imagination had pictured her. A new feeling
possessed me. In vain I called pride to my aid&mdash;I could
not drive her from my thoughts. Sleeping or waking, her
voice and form were ever present. I left the town for a
time to free myself from these unwelcome feelings, pleasing
as they were. I felt angry at myself for harbouring
them; but all my endeavours were vain&mdash;go where I
would, I was with my Mary on the Cowdenknowes.</p>

<p>I know not how it was. I had loved with more ardour
in my first passion, and been more the victim of impulse;
a dreamy sensation occupied my mind, and my whole
existence seemed concentrated in her alone; now, my
mind felt cool and collected&mdash;I weighed every fault and
excellence; still I was hurried on, and felt like one placed
in a boat in the current of a river, pulling hard to get out
of the stream in vain. I at length laid down my oars, and
yielded to the impulse. In short, I made up my mind to
win the esteem and love of Mary; nor did I strive in vain.
My humble attentions were kindly received, and dear to
my heart is the remembrance of the timid glances I first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
detected in her full black eyes. For some weeks I sought
an opportunity to declare my love. She evidently shunned
being alone with me; and I often could discern, when I
came upon her by surprise, that she had been weeping.
Some secret sorrow evidently oppressed her mind, and, at
times, I have seen her beautiful face suffused with scarlet
and her eyes become wet with tears, when my pompous
landlady spoke of the ladies of Europe and &ldquo;the <em>true</em>
white-blooded females of America.&rdquo; I dreamed not at this time
of the cause; but the truth dawned upon me afterwards.</p>

<p>It was on a delightful evening, after one of the most
sultry days in this climate, I had wandered into the garden
to enjoy the evening breeze, with which nothing in these
northern climes will bear comparison; the fire-flies sported
in myriads around, and gave animation to the scene; the
fragrance of plants and the melody of birds filled the senses
to repletion. I wanted only the presence of Mary to be
completely happy. I heard a low warbling at a short distance,
from a bower covered with clustering vines. It was
Mary&#8217;s voice! I stood overpowered with pleasure&mdash;she
sung again one of our Scottish tunes.</p>

<p>As the last faint cadence died away, I entered the arbour;
the noise of my approach made her start from her seat;
she was hurrying away in confusion, when I gently seized
her hand, and requested her to remain, if it were only for
a few moments, as I had something to impart of the utmost
importance to us both. She stood; her face was averted
from my gaze; I felt her hand tremble in mine. Now that
the opportunity I so much desired had been obtained, my
resolution began to fail me. We had stood thus for sometime.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, I must not stay here longer,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Good evening!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I love you. May I hope to gain your
regard by any length of service? Allow me to hope, and I
shall be content.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
&ldquo;I must not listen to this language,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Do
not hope. There is a barrier between us that cannot be
removed. I cannot be yours. I am unworthy of your
regard. Alas! I am a child of misfortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;my hopes of happiness are fled for ever.
So young, so beautiful, with a soul so elevated as I know
yours to be, you can have done nothing to render you
unworthy of me. For heaven&#8217;s sake, tell me what that
fatal barrier is. Is it love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;You do me but justice.
A thought has never dwelt upon my mind for which I have
cause to blush; but Nature has placed a gulf between you
and me, you will not pass.&rdquo; She paused, and the tears
swam in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For mercy&#8217;s sake, proceed!&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>There is black blood in these veins</em>,&rdquo; she cried, in
agony.</p>

<p>A load was at once removed from my mind. I raised
her hand to my lips:&mdash;&ldquo;Mary, my love, this is no bar. I
come from a country where the aristocracy of blood is
unknown, where nothing degrades man in the eyes of his
fellow-man but vice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why more? Mary consented to be mine, and we were
shortly after wed. I was blessed in the possession of one
of the most gentle of beings.</p>

<p>We had been married about six or seven weeks, when
business called me from Charleston to one of the northern
States. I resolved to take Mary with me, as I was to go
by sea; and our arrangements were completed. The vessel
was to sail on the following day. I was seated with her,
enjoying the cool of the evening, when a stranger called
and requested to see me on business of importance. I
immediately went to him, and was struck with the coarseness
of his manners, and his vulgar importance. I bowed,
and asked his business.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
&ldquo;You have a woman in this house,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;called
Mary De Lyle, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand the purport of your question,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My meaning is pretty clear,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Mary De Lyle
is in this house, and she is my property. If you offer to
carry her out of the State, I will have her sent to jail, and
you fined. That is right ahead, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wretch,&rdquo; said I, in a voice hoarse with rage, &ldquo;get out
of my house, or I will crush you to death. Begone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I believe I would have done him some fearful injury,
had he not precipitately made his escape. In a frame of
mind I want words to express, I hurried to Mary, and sank
upon a seat, with my face buried in my hands. She, poor
thing, came trembling to my side, and implored me to tell
her what was the matter. I could only answer by my
groans. At length, I looked imploringly in her face:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary, is it possible that you are a slave?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>She uttered a piercing shriek, and sank inanimate at my
feet. I lifted her upon the sofa; but it was long before she
gave symptoms of returning life.</p>

<p>As soon as I could leave her, I went to a friend to ask
his advice and assistance. Through him, I learned that
what I feared was but too true. By the usages and laws of
the State, she was still a slave, and liable to be hurried
from me and sold to the highest bidder, or doomed to any
drudgery her master might put her to, and even flogged
at will. There was only one remedy that could be applied;
and the specific was dollars. My friend was so kind as to
negotiate with the ruffian. One thousand was demanded,
and cheerfully paid. I carried the manumission home to
my sorrowing Mary. From her I learned, as she lay in
bed&mdash;her beautiful face buried in the clothes, and her voice
choked by sobs&mdash;that the wretch who had called on me
was her own father, whose avarice could not let slip this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
opportunity of extorting money. With an inconsistency
often found in man, he had given Mary one of the best of
educations, and for long treated her as a favoured child,
during the life of her mother, who was one of his slaves, a
woman of colour, and with some accomplishments, which
she had acquired in a genteel family. At her death, Mary
had gone as governess to my landlady; but, until the day
of her father&#8217;s claim, she had never dreamed of being a
slave. I allowed the vessel to sail without me, wound up
my affairs, and bade adieu for ever to the slave States. &#8217;Tis
now twenty years since I purchased a wife, after I had won
her love, and I bless the day she was made mine; for I
have had uninterrupted happiness in her and her offspring.
The slave is now the happy wife and mother of five lovely
children, who rejoice in their mother. After remaining
some years in Leeds, I returned to Edinburgh. Widow
Neil was dead; but one day I discovered, by mere chance,
that the murder I committed in her house was on a <em>sheep</em>.</p>

<h2>MY BLACK COAT;</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>OR,</strong></p>

<p class="center"><strong>THE BREAKING OF THE BRIDE&#8217;S CHINA.</strong></p>


<p>Gentle reader, the simple circumstances I am about to
relate to you, hang upon what is termed&mdash;a bad omen.
There are few amongst the uneducated who have not a
degree of faith in omens; and even amongst the better
educated and well informed there are many who, while
they profess to disbelieve them, and, indeed, do disbelieve
them, yet feel them in their hours of solitude. I have
known individuals who, in the hour of danger, would have
braved the cannon&#8217;s mouth, or defied death to his teeth,
who, nevertheless, would have buried their heads in the
bedclothes at the howling of a dog at midnight, or spent a
sleepless night from hearing the tick, tick, of the spider, or
the untiring song of the kitchen-fire musician&mdash;the jolly
little cricket. The age of omens, however, is drawing to a
close; for truth in its progress is trampling delusion of
every kind under its feet; yet, after all, though a belief in
omens is a superstition, it is one that carries with it a portion
of the poetry of our nature. But to proceed with our story.</p>

<p>Several years ago I was on my way from B&mdash;&mdash; to
Edinburgh; and being as familiar with every cottage,
tree, shrub, and whin-bush on the Dunbar and Lauder
roads as with the face of an acquaintance, I made choice
of the less-frequented path by Longformacus. I always
took a secret pleasure in contemplating the dreariness of
wild spreading desolation; and, next to looking on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
sea when its waves dance to the music of a hurricane, I
loved to gaze on the heath-covered wilderness, where the
blue horizon only girded its purple bosom. It was no
season to look upon the heath in the beauty of barrenness,
yet I purposely diverged from the main road. About an
hour, therefore, after I had descended from the region on
the Lammermoors, and entered the Lothians, I became
sensible I was pursuing a path which was not forwarding
my footsteps to Edinburgh. It was December; the sun
had just gone down; I was not very partial to travelling
in darkness, neither did I wish to trust to chance for finding
a comfortable resting-place for the night. Perceiving a
farm-steading and water-mill about a quarter of a mile
from the road, I resolved to turn towards them, and make
inquiry respecting the right path, or, at least, to request
to be directed to the nearest inn.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;town,&rdquo; as the three or four houses and mill were
called, was all bustle and confusion. The female inhabitants
were cleaning and scouring, and running to and fro.
I quickly learned that all this note of preparation arose
from the &ldquo;maister&rdquo; being to be married within three
days. Seeing me a stranger, he came from his house
towards me. He was a tall, stout, good-looking, jolly-faced
farmer and miller. His manner of accosting me
partook more of kindness than civility; and his inquiries
were not free from the familiar, prying curiosity which
prevails in every corner of our island, and, I must say, in
the north in particular.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you come fra, na&mdash;if it be a fair question?&rdquo;
inquired he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From B&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; was the brief and merely civil reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&#8217; hae ye come frae there the day?&rdquo; he continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, man, an&#8217; ye come frae B&mdash;&mdash;, do ye?&rdquo; added he;
&ldquo;then, nae doot, ye&#8217;ll ken a person they ca&#8217; Mr.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
&ldquo;Did he come originally from Dunse?&rdquo; returned I,
mentioning also the occupation of the person referred to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The vera same,&rdquo; rejoined the miller; &ldquo;are ye acquainted
wi&#8217; him, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ought to be,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;the person you speak of is
merely my father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your faither!&rdquo; exclaimed he, opening his mouth and
eyes to their full width, and standing for a moment the
picture of surprise&mdash;&ldquo;Gude gracious! ye dinna say sae!&mdash;is
he really your faither? Losh, man, do you no ken,
then, that I&#8217;m your cousin! Ye&#8217;ve heard o&#8217; your cousin,
Willie Stewart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fifty times,&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, I&#8217;m the vera man,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;Gie&#8217;s your hand;
for, &#8217;odsake, man, I&#8217;m as glad as glad can be. This is real
extraordinar&#8217;. I&#8217;ve often heard o&#8217; you&mdash;it will be you that
writes the buiks&mdash;faith ye&#8217;ll be able to mak something o&#8217;
this. But come awa&#8217; into the house&mdash;ye dinna stir a mile
far&#8217;er for a week, at ony rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, and still grasping my hand, he led me to the
farm-house. On crossing the threshold&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, lassie,&rdquo; he cried, in a voice that made roof and
rafters ring, &ldquo;bring ben the speerits, and get on the
kettle&mdash;here&#8217;s a cousin that I ne&#8217;er saw in my life afore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few minutes served mutually to confirm and explain
our newly-discovered relationship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man,&rdquo; said he, as we were filling a second glass,
&ldquo;ye&#8217;ve just come in the very nick o&#8217; time; an&#8217; I&#8217;ll tell ye
how. Ye see I&#8217;m gaun to be married the day after the
morn; an&#8217; no haein&#8217; a friend o&#8217; ony kin-kind in this quarter,
I had to ask an acquaintance to be the best man.
Now, this was vexin&#8217; me mair than ye can think, particularly,
ye see, because the sweetheart has aye been hinting
to me that it wadna be lucky for me no to hae a bluid
relation for a best man. For that matter, indeed, luck
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
here, luck there, I no care the toss up o&#8217; a ha&#8217;penny about
omens mysel&#8217;; but now that ye&#8217;ve fortunately come, I&#8217;m a
great deal easier, an&#8217; it will be ae craik out o&#8217; the way, for
it will please her; an&#8217; ye may guess, between you an&#8217; me,
that she&#8217;s worth the pleasin&#8217;, or I wadna had her; so I&#8217;ll
just step ower an&#8217; tell the ither lad that I hae a cousin come
to be my best man, an&#8217; he&#8217;ll think naething o&#8217;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the morning of the third day, the bride and her
friends arrived. She was the only child of a Lammermoor
farmer, and was in truth a real mountain flower&mdash;a heath
blossom; for the rude health that laughed upon her cheeks
approached nearer the hue of the heather-bell, than the
rose and vermillion of which poets speak. She was comely
withal, possessing an appearance of considerable strength,
and was rather above the middle size&mdash;in short, she was
the very belle ideal of a miller&#8217;s wife!</p>

<p>But to go on. Twelve couples accompanied the happy
miller and his bride to the manse, independent of the
married, middle-aged, and grey-haired visitors, who followed
behind and by our side. We were thus proceeding
onward to the house of the minister, whose blessing was to
make a couple happy, and the arm of the blooming bride
was through mine, when I heard a voice, or rather let me
say a sound, like the croak of a raven, exclaim&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mercy on us! saw ye e&#8217;er the like o&#8217; that!&mdash;the best
man, I&#8217;ll declare, has a black coat on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&#8217; that&#8217;s no lucky!&rdquo; replied another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucky!&rdquo; responded the raven voice&mdash;&ldquo;just perfectly
awfu&#8217;! I wadna it had happened at the weddin&#8217; o&#8217; a bairn
o&#8217; mine for the king&#8217;s dominions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I observed the bride steal a glance at my shoulder; I
felt, or thought I felt, as if she shrunk from my arm; and
when I spoke to her, her speech faltered. I found that
my cousin, in avoiding one omen, had stumbled upon
another, in my black coat. I was wroth with the rural
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
prophetess, and turned round to behold her. Her little
grey eyes, twinkling through spectacles, were wink, winking
upon my ill-fated coat. She was a crooked (forgive
me for saying an ugly), little, old woman; she was
&ldquo;bearded like a pard,&rdquo; and walked with a crooked stick
mounted with silver. (On the very spot<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a>
where she then
was, the last witch in Scotland was burned.) I turned
from the grinning sibyl with disgust.</p>

<p>On the previous day, and during part of the night, the
rain had fallen heavily, and the Broxburn was swollen to
the magnitude of a little river. The manse lay on the
opposite side of the burn, which was generally crossed by
the aid of stepping-stones, but on the day in question the
tops of the stones were barely visible. On crossing the
burn the foot of the bride slipped, and the bridegroom, in
his eagerness to assist her, slipped also&mdash;knee-deep in the
water. The raven voice was again heard&mdash;it was another omen.</p>

<p>The kitchen was the only room in the manse large
enough to contain the spectators assembled to witness the
ceremony, which passed over smoothly enough, save that,
when the clergyman was about to join the hands of the
parties, I drew off the glove of the bride a second or two
before the bridesmaid performed a similar operation on
the hand of the bridegroom. I heard the whisper of the
crooked old woman, and saw that the eyes of the other
women were upon me. I felt that I had committed another
omen, and almost resolved to renounce wearing &ldquo;blacks&rdquo;
for the future. The ceremony, however, was concluded;
we returned from the manse, and everything was forgotten,
save mirth and music, till the hour arrived for tea.</p>

<p>The bride&#8217;s mother had boasted of her &ldquo;daughter&#8217;s
double set o&#8217; real china&rdquo; during the afternoon; and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
female part of the company evidently felt anxious to
examine the costly crockery. A young woman was entering
with a tray and the tea equipage&mdash;another, similarly
laden, followed behind her. The &ldquo;sneck&rdquo; of the door
caught the handle of the tray, and down went china,
waiting-maid, and all! The fall startled her companion&mdash;their
feet became entangled&mdash;both embraced the floor, and
the china from both trays lay scattered around them in a
thousand shapes and sizes! This was an omen with a
vengeance! I could not avoid stealing a look at the sleeve
of my black coat. The bearded old woman seemed inspired.
She declared the luck of the house was broken!
Of the double set of real china not a cup was left&mdash;not an
odd saucer. The bridegroom bore the misfortune as a
man; and, gently drawing the head of his young partner
towards him, said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind them, hinny&mdash;let them gang&mdash;we&#8217;ll get mair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bride, poor thing, shed a tear; but the miller
threw his arm round her neck, stole a kiss, and she
blushed and smiled.</p>

<p>It was evident, however, that every one of the company
regarded this as a real omen. The mill-loft was prepared
for the joyous dance; but scarce had the fantastic toes
(some of them were not light ones) begun to move through
the mazy rounds, when the loft-floor broke down beneath
the bounding feet of the happy-hearted miller; for, unfortunately,
he considered not that his goodly body was
heavier than his spirits. It was omen upon omen&mdash;the
work of breaking had begun&mdash;the &ldquo;luck&rdquo; of the young
couple was departed.</p>

<p>Three days after the wedding, one of the miller&#8217;s carts
was got in readiness to carry home the bride&#8217;s mother.
On crossing the unlucky burn, to which we have already
alluded, the horse stumbled, fell, and broke its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
knee, and had to be taken back, and another put in its
place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mair breakings!&rdquo; exclaimed the now almost heart-broken
old woman. &ldquo;Oh, dear sake! how will a&#8217; this
end for my puir bairn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I remained with my new-found relatives about a week;
and while there the miller sent his boy for payment of an
account of thirty pounds, he having to make up money to
pay a corn-factor at the Haddington market on the following
day. In the evening the boy returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, callant,&rdquo; inquired the miller, &ldquo;hae ye gotten the siller?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mercy me!&rdquo; exclaimed my cousin, hastily, &ldquo;hae ye
no gotten the siller? Wha did ye see, or what did they
say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw the wife,&rdquo; returned the boy; &ldquo;an&#8217; she said&mdash;&lsquo;Siller!
laddie, what&#8217;s brought ye here for siller?&mdash;I daresay
your maister&#8217;s daft! Do ye no ken we&#8217;re broken! I&#8217;m
sure a&#8217;body kens that we broke yesterday!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mischief break them!&rdquo; exclaimed the miller,
rising and walking hurriedly across the
room&mdash;&ldquo;this is breaking in earnest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I may not here particularize the breakings that followed.
One misfortune succeeded another, till the miller broke
also. All that he had was put under the hammer, and he
wandered forth with his young wife a broken man.</p>

<p>Some years afterwards, I met with him in a different
part of the country. He had the management of extensive
flour mills. He was again doing well, and had money
in his master&#8217;s hands. At last there seemed to be an end
of the breakings. We were sitting together when a third
person entered, with a rueful countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Willie,&rdquo; said he, with the tone of a speaking sepulchre,
&ldquo;hae ye heard the news?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
&ldquo;What news, now?&rdquo; inquired the miller, seriously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The maister&#8217;s broken!&rdquo; rejoined the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&#8217; my fifty pounds?&rdquo; responded my cousin, in a
voice of horror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are broken wi&#8217; him,&rdquo; returned the stranger. &ldquo;Oh,
gude gracious!&rdquo; cried the young wife, wringing her hands,
&ldquo;I&#8217;m sure I wish I were out o&#8217; this world!&mdash;will ever thir
breakings be done!&mdash;what tempted my mother to buy me the cheena?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or me to wear a black coat at your wedding,&rdquo;
thought I.</p>

<p>A few weeks afterwards a letter arrived, announcing
that death had suddenly broken the thread of life of her
aged father, and her mother requested them to come and
take charge of the farm which was now theirs. They
went. The old man had made money on the hills. They
got the better of the broken china and of my black coat.
Fortune broke in upon them. My cousin declared that
omens were nonsense, and his wife added that
she &ldquo;really thought there was naething in them. But it was
lang an&#8217; mony a day,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;or I could get your black coat
and my mother&#8217;s cheena out o&#8217; my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They began to prosper and they prosper still.</p>

of the same kind as that possessed by Lucian, Lord Lyttleton,

least be well satisfied that the parts of the conversation
sustained by the principal interlocutor are true to the genius

Round about the shores of Loch Skene the Ettrick Shepherd
herded the flocks of his master, and fed his boyish fancies with the
romance and beauty which breathes from every feature of the scene. One
day, when we were at Loch Skene on a fishing excursion with him, he
pointed up to the black crag overhanging the water, and said&mdash;&ldquo;You see
the edge o&#8217; that cliff; I ance as near dropped frae it intil eternity
as I dinna care to think o&#8217;. I was herdin&#8217; aboot here, and lang and lang
I thocht o&#8217; speelin&#8217; up to the eyry, frae which I could hear the young
eagles screamin&#8217; as plain as my ain bonny Mary Gray (his youngest
daughter) when she&#8217;s no pleased wi&#8217; the colley; but the fear o&#8217; the
auld anes aye keepit me frae the attempt. At last, ae day, when I was at
the head o&#8217; the cliff, and the auld eagle away frae the nest, I took
heart o&#8217; grace, and clambered down (for there was nae gettin&#8217; up). Weel,
sir, I was at the maist kittle bit o&#8217; the craig, wi&#8217; my foot on a bit
ledge just wide enough to bear me, and sair bothered wi&#8217; my plaid and
stick, when, guid saf&#8217;s! I heard the boom o&#8217; the auld eagle&#8217;s wings come
whaff, whaffing through the air, and in a moment o&#8217; time she brought me
sic a whang wi&#8217; her wing, as she rushed enraged by, and then turning
short again and fetching me anither, I thought I was gane for ever; but
providence gave me presence o&#8217; mind to regain my former resting-place,
and there flinging off my plaid, I keepit aye nobbing the bird wi&#8217; my
stick till I was out o&#8217; danger. It was a fearsome time!&rdquo; It would have
been dreadful had the pleasure which &ldquo;Kilmeny,&rdquo; &ldquo;Queen Hynde,&rdquo; and the
hundred other beautiful creations which the glorious old bard has given
us, been all thus destroyed &ldquo;at one fell swoop.&rdquo;</p></div>

Sir Walter Scott says that &ldquo;the number of slain in
the field did not exceed three or four hundred.&rdquo; All the
authorities I have seen state the number at a thousand. He also
accuses Lesly of abusing his victory by slaughtering many
of his prisoners in cold blood. Now, it is true that
a hundred of the Irish adventurers were shot; but this was in
pursuance of an act of both Parliaments, and not from any private
revenge on the part of General Lesly.</p></div>
